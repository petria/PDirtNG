BUG <msg>
Leaves a bug message for the game admins.  If the message you must leave is
going to be long, please mail a god instead.  Please give as much information
as possible about the bug.  It is generally in your interest to report a bug
rather than exploit it, for if you are caught exploiting it, bad things
may happen.  >:>
