[A]WARN [player] <message>
[A]This command works with the following policy in mind: Vocal Warning,
[A]Exorcise, WarnZap, Zap. It checks the current status of the player, and
[A]executes the next step. So if someone is Exorcised, it will do a 
[A]ZapWarning.
[A]
[A]If a message is specified, that message will be shown instead of the 
[A]default. To clear warnings, use clearwarn. Exorcise and warnzap will
[A]set the flags as well, but by using this command you can be sure you 
[A]follow the policy, besides that, it doesn't do a pflag-check yet, so
[A]no matter what happens, this WILL work.
[A]
[A]If the player logs in, his/her warning level will show up to all Awiz+
[A]with the message to check the board. (every warn should also be 
[A]explained there)
