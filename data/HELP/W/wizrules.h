[X]WIZRULES
[X]  Not a command.
[X]
[X]Wizards are not permitted to give away actual figures concerning the
[X]statistics of items and mobiles, under no circumstances will you divulge
[X]damage, armor class, strength, size, hit points or any other such value.
[X]
[X]Wizards may not divulge quest information, although vague and/or cryptic
[X]clues are allowed. 
[X]
[X]Wizards may not recover pitted items for mortals. Deathrooms are a 
[X]different matter; higher level players should know better, however
[X]recovering items for low level players is acceptable provided you are
[X]resonably certain its all their own stuff and only if they return
[X]immediatly after dying. This is another case of "Use your own judgement".
[X]
[X]In general you should make an effort to help out newbies, making sure
[X]they know the basics and have been shown the fountain. Mortals should
[X]get less help the higher level they are.
