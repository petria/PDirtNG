MOBILE
Not a command.

If a command expects a mobile as argument, it may be given as either one of:
1) <mobile-name>
2) <mobile-name><number-in-room-with-that-name>

Example, if there are 5 orcs in a room, and you want to kill the 2nd, you
could say "kill orc2".  "kill orc1" and "kill orc" means the 1st orc.

[X]3) <number>
[X]
[X]This is the unique mobile-ID number that shows up on the WHERE command.
[X]Examples:  "at 1512 kiss 1512", "heal 1611", "give biscuit to 1779"
