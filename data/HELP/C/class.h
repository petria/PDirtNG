CLASS
Not a command.  A class is a type of object.  The following classes
are defined:

        all      = everything
        clothing = anything that can be worn (including shields)
        containers = anything you can put other objects in
        food     = anything edible
        keys     = anything used as a key
        weapons  = all weapons (you may be surprised)

In addition, modifiers and adjectives are allowed in all commands which deal
with objects.  For example: Suppose there are three robes in the room...

        There is a black robe here.
        There is a scarlet robe here.
        There is a green robe here.

If you want the scarlet robe, you could either say "get scarlet",
or "get robe2" (see also OBJECT)
