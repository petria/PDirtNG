&+WFree&*: means that the quest has not been finished, and is free to try to
      anyone who likes. It may however be that some vital things are missing.
&+YProg&*: Someone is busy trying to solve the quest (In Progress), or is 
      passing through the area that contains the quest. For some quests its

      anymore.
