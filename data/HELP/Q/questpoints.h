QUESTPOINTS
Not a command, but some text on the questpoints system. in your score
you can see the total amount of questpoints and the amount of questpoints
you have accumulated.

However: you don't need the total amount of questpoints to wiz. You need
	 a total of 55 points to become apprentice wizard.
         You do need all required quests though.
