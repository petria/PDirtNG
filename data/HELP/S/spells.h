SPELLS (not a command)

DarkScapes has its own selfcreated Spell system which allows us to create
spells you can't find on an original Aber, and some maybe not even on any
mud you may know.

Once you have learned a new spell you can ask information about it by typing
&+WHELP <spellname>&*.

You can cast spells by typing &+WCAST <spellname> <other options>&* or sometimes by
just typing &+W<spellname> <options>&*.
