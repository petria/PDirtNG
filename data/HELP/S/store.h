[X]STORE <player-name>
[X]If not followed by any argument, it means yourself.
[X]This command creates a zone for you, its name will be your characters name.
[X]It is not intended for making zones for mortals to adventure in,
[X]but it lets you build your own personal stuff with much more fun and ease
[X]then the traditional way of bugging your God do it for you.
[X]The STORE command does the following:
[X]
[X]- Marks all mobiles/locations/objects you have created (with CLONE) as non-
[X]  temporary, so that they will be reset on a reset instead of destructed.
[X]
[X]- Sets their reset-values to the exact state the mobiles/locations/objects
[X]  are in when the STORE command is issued. Your zone will be reset on every
[X]  reset to the exact state it was in, the last time you did a STORE.
[X]
[X]- Saves everything on disk, so that you may LOAD your zone at a later time.
[X]  Your zone will remain in the the game even after you quit,
[X]  but will go away if you don't come back within a certain period of time,
[X]  (currently 3 days). It will in any case be loaded again automatically the
[X]  next time you enter the game.     See also LOAD, CLONE, DESTRUCT, RESET
