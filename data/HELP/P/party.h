PARTY
On this mud we have an grouping system called party. It allows multiple
players to share experience points and assist eachother in fight. The system
works with a share system. Every player gets an amount of shares, and thus
receives an amount of experience equal to the size of his shares. A player
can only be member of one party at a given moment.

The party has several commands:
- &+WPCREATE&* : This command will create a new party for you. 
- &+WPLEAVE&*  : Leave the party you are currently in. 
- &+WPADD&*    : Add a player to the party. 
- &+WPLEADER&* : Change leader of the group.
- &+WPSHARE&*  : Change the shares for a player.
- &+WPSAY&*    : Tell all players in the party something.
- &+WPFOLLOW&* : Start following the leader.
- &+WPNAME&*   : Change the name of the party.
- &+WPREMOVE&* : Remove a player from a party.
[X]- &+WPARTIES&* : Show details for party's.
