FLEE or FLEE <direction>
Escapes from a fight.  Please note that fleeing causes you to drop anything
that you are not wielding or wearing.  You will also lose 3% of your score,
which is a lot better than the 50% you would lose by dying.  Without
<direction>, FLEE will move you through a randomly-chosen exit.
