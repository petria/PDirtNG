AUTOEAT
This option comes in handy when fighting mobiles. When your strength reaches 
your wimpy value, it will search your inventory for anything to eat and will
eat it to regain strength without fleeing.

&+RWARNING&*: Because the autoeat option also searches your containers, like
          bags etc, it can make you eat things you shouldnt eat in order to
          solve a quest!
