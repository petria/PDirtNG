HEALALL
[!PHealall]Once in a while an immortal can cast an healing flux that heals all the
[!PHealall]mortals in the game. Because of the effectiviness of this spell it can
[!PHealall]only be performed once every 10 minutes.
[PHealall]replenishes all non-fighting mortals to their full strength.  Because it 
[PHealall]is inherently more fair, performing a healall is probably better than
[PHealAll]doing a HEAL if you have that pflag as well.  There is a 10 minute timer
[PHealAll]on HEALALL.
[A]Arch wizards and above may over-ride the time limit by typing healall plus
[A]some other character.
