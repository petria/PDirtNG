[PReset & X]invocation of the STORE command will be destroyed.

[PReset & X]   If the Wizard that owns the zone has not been on for a certain
[PReset & X]period of time (currently 3 days), even his STOREd creations will
[PReset & X]go away, but they will reappear the next time he enters the game.
[PReset & X]
[PReset & X]   After a RESET [stored wiz-zone] has been issued, the number of
[PReset & X]items successfully reset will be displayed. This just means that
[PReset & X]those not successfully reset were supposed to have been placed
[PReset & X]somewhere (in a room, carried by someone) that was not currently
[PReset & X]LOADed into the game.
