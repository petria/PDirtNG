stable after the storm struck. A small bar has been made of some wood and
barrels. Some of the stables have been converted to provide an improvised
sleeping room for the paying guests. 
   The floor of the tap-room has been covered by wooden planks to beautify
the room. Although its all very primitive it still has a nice ambience.

   You stand on the bank of a river that cuts through the plain. The river is

river, waiting patiently.

   This mound of rocks could have been the ancient remains of a watchtower
that afforded a good view of the river. The far bank looks even more desolate
and forbidding than the near one. It is probably a good thing that the river
separates them. Up river, to the north, the current is much swifter as it
gushes through a rocky narrow canyon. To the south the river winds it way
slowly out of sight.

actually little more than a raft propelled by polling it along the slow
current. From here you could return to the eastern bank, though you get
the feeling that few passengers do. Charon is not here now, but there is
a collection box with a coin slot in it.

of grayish brown and yellow. Even though the water moves slowly here, movement
upstream would be impossible without supernatural help.

out of sight into a dark pit. A small sign, hand painted in blood, tells you: 

     &+RMortals keep out!&*

A black door set into the face of the cliff has a dark arrow above it pointing
down. A sign pasted on the door informs you the elevator is out of order.
For those hearty souls, a large, circular stairway has been carved into the
cliff face, allowing you to make the long descent into the black pit.

them, prevents you from going further down.

Words cut into the rock next to the entry remove all doubt who dwells here:

       I, Guxx Unfufadoo, rule this region
       soon your head I'll be a squeezin'

A gap in the stairs above you prevents you from going up.

  This is the southern end of a bridge, which crosses a dark chasm. The bridge
is made of spider webbing, but is far from fragile. The main cables supporting
the bridge are as big as a man's forearm. It's enough to make you wonder what
kind of spider could make such silk.

   The spider webs cover everything here. If you were a spider, it would be 
easy to get around, otherwise the only way you could go and not get caught in 
the webs is northward, into a dark smelly tunnel. You could also climb up a
single strand of webbing that hangs down directly over the tunnel. Or you could
cross the bridge back to the south.

the side of the tunnel. To the north the tunnel widens into a room and a sense
of great evil comes from that direction.

&+WDemon Web&*^
   You are in a pocket at the center of a particulary large system of webs.
At the center of the room is a large black altar. Fresh blood drips from the
altar, forming a pool at its base and from there runs toward a large archway
to the north. Smaller archways lead east and west.

   Uh, oh... this isn't Kansas anymore Toto. You have stumbled onto the lair
of the Demon Queen of Spiders. Darkness prevails here. Even the strongest
light source can illuminate only a small portion of this chamber. A touch
of the wall nearest you reveals a sticky substance and you are standing in
a pool of warm liquid.

door to the south. The door has a dark arrow above it pointing up and a
small green button beside it.

A piece of slate has been mounted on the back wall and on the slate are

You find yourself on the edge of a vast mountain range. To the east you can
see a large square-shaped clearing. Further east you can see some kind of a
temple while on the north-east on the edge of you sight lie two pyramid-
shaped buildings. Despite the strange looking buildings you find the eastward
path more inviting than the high mountains to the west.

You are standing on a large square-shaped clearing. Pieces of old weapons 
and arrowheads on the ground tell you that the grass over here has once been
manured with blood. Nearby to the north you see the San Juan river. Passages 
lead west towards a mountain range and east to a some kind of a street.

You find yourself on an ancient passageway which seems to have been the 
main street of an old town. The street is wide and paved with large grey 
flagstones. The street leads to the north while the southern way disappears 
under flourishing grass mat. The path to the west leads to a clearing and to 
the east there is a temple.

A long time ago this town might have been a major center in this area. However,
time has done its' job and you can hardly discern the pavement under your
feet. The street leads north into the town. To the south there is a swamp 
which does not look very inviting.

You are standing on a large opening covered with grass right before a huge

stairway leading up to its' top. You see large stone animal figures beside
the stairs. You can still go back west to the street.

You are going your way up the temple stairs sweating and panting. Breathing
deeply you stop and lean against a statue besides the stairs. Examining the 
statue more closely, you figure out that the statue is actually a big head of
a snake decorated with stony feathers. The snake has an evil grin on his face 
and you are glad it is not alive. The stairs lead upwards to the top of the
temple and down back to the clearing.

Looking back down where you came from makes you feel dizzy so you decide 
to pay more attention to a huge monolith laying before you. The monolith 
is four feet high and twelve feet wide. Its' face is smooth, but covered 
with dark red and brown spots all over it. This is probably a place where
the priests of this ancient city used to worship their God of Earth and the 
Universe later known as Quetzalcoatl by the Aztecs. The sight could easily 
turn a flesh-eating beast to a true vegetarian.

You are following a wide street paved with large flagstones. The street

way over a river. Two great pyramids are dominating the northern horizon
while to the south-east there's a temple of some sort.

&+WThe Bridge&*^
You have arrived at a wide stone bridge. The bridge consists of four huge 
monoliths placed side by side over the river and pavement made of smaller 
flagstones quite like the others in the town. The San Juan river flows 
gently under the bridge to the east. You are considering a little refreshing
dive into the river, but as you see all the alligators you think it might
be better to take a boat.

Your small boat floats slowly along the river. You notice a slight increase
in the speed the river flows. You look at the river bank to find a nice calm
place to get ashore. The shore, however, is crowded by alligators and you
find it quite forbidding. You have to choose whether to keep going further
east or back west to the bridge.

between the river and the alligators. You are breathing heavily as you 
try to keep your boat steady. The river continues east and west. To the 
northern shore you see some sort of building. Unfortunately you have to 
pass by some hungry alligators before you can step ashore. You desperately
try to remember how Crocodile Dundee did the trick.

small boat upside down making you wish you were a salmon. All this time 
the river flows endlessly to the sea.

prepare yourself for the battle. The alligators, however, start preparing 
themselves for dinner. They obviously liked your decision which makes you 
think that maybe it would have been a better idea to go further east along 
the river despite the rapids. To the north you see a little sanctuary.

Your heart beats fast and you stop for a while to breath deep and recover
from the battle with the alligators. You have an odd feeling that Mr Dundee
didn't have so much trouble with the 'gators. You wipe the sweat from your 
forehead and look around. You find yourself in a small room sanctified to 
some God of these unknown people. On the north wall there stands a small 
bronze statue decorated with colorful stones. The statue stands firmly on 
the floor and it's almost impossible to move. The stone decorations, 
however, seem to be quite loose on the statue. Maybe you still can bring 
something home to your sweetheart from your adventures - if you survive, 
that is.

marshlands. The mosquitos have found your blood very tasty and you start 
slapping them on your skin. If this is what it is like here, what might it 
be when you go further to the west?  You wonder if you will catch malaria 
in this place.  The path leads west and back to the east.

A number of magnum size mosquitos attack you buzzing madly of thirst for 
your blood. You feel, however, strong devotion to your liquid of life and
decide not to give up without a fight. As you prepare yourself for the 
battle you quickly look around and notice two escape ways - one back east 
where the less enormous mosquitos were and one south to the river bank.

you draw the conclusion that there might be one more cross like this 
somewhere in the town (what a detective!).

pyramid breaks the horizon. To the east you see a massive building made 
of clay and stones rising up to the skies before you. At this very moment 
the greatness of this ancient culture fills your mind and you can't help 
looking at this breathtaking view while holding your breath. You shake your
head and draw your mind back to reality. To the west you notice a small house.

stone platform in the middle of the room. This might have been some kind 
of a hospital or something. You hear a loud crack!

The closer you get, the bigger it becomes. Before the pyramid you see a

itself.

used for observing the planets and stars. The planet Venus, seems to have 
had some significance to these people - maybe as a God or something like
that.

Before you, the moon shines brightly, appearing to be a gigantic wheel of

slice of that great big cheese. Before you on the floor there is a big cross-
shaped figure. The carvings on the stone floor are telling tales about secret
halls of ancient kings and holy men.  You wonder where these mighty halls
might be located, and you think that the cross has something to do with it.

&+WSouthern Side Tunnel&*^
The tunnel is widening as you move further to the south and seems to end
in a small chamber just a few yards before you. The walls are glistening
in the dim light coming from your torch. It looks like the rock around you
would consist of various valuable minerals. Despite this splendid sight 
you feel quite uncomfortable and start feeling dizzy for some reason.

&+WRoom of the Lost Hope&*^
You see pieces of old bleached bones covering the ground. Hundreds of 
cockroaches have occupied a skeleton of some poor adventurer in the corner.
Even though this is a miserable sight you are still wondering, why is this 
place called the room of the lost hope...

Suddenly you notice that you no longer need a torch, because the walls of 
this cave are emitting dim light. The light turns brighter as you walk 
north along the cave.

&+WThe Edge of Downtown&*^
As you walk further the walls turn smooth and the floor is covered with
complicated and extremely beautiful ornaments. The ornaments are surrounding 
a long series of small pictures that seem to tell tales about this town's 
history. The story begins with a flourishing dynasty and an emperor who 
ruled the surrounding plains. To find out more you have to walk further 
to a large underground hall to the north. You notice that you still can 
turn back to the south.

&+WThe Square of the Souls Forgotten&*^
The story of the pictures goes on as you enter a large hall that has exits 
to all directions. You find out that, not long before the town above you was
abandoned, the astronomers found a new bright star in the sky. The star
was thought to be a sign of destruction coming to the town. You can see 
more of these pictures leading to each direction.

You step into a less decorated room that is obviously meant to be the 
servants' accomodation. There's a table before the back wall and a lamp 
brings light into this otherwise dim chamber. By studying the pictures on 
the floor, you find out that most of the slaves and servants were killed
when the upper class moved down underground. The ghosts of these poor people
still wander these lands of blood. To prevent the ghosts from entering
the underground town many guardians have been placed at the entrance.
The only exit is to the east.

&+WThe Hall of the Sun God&*^
You feel strong magical powers surrounding you as you enter this room. 
The story tells that there was a disc of the mighty Sun God originally 
placed on top of the huge sun pyramid by the sun God himself. After the 
messages about the destruction were received, the priests had a holy 
stone and a feather of the sacred Quetzalbird, brought from a hermit 
living at the Tropic of Cancer to move this holy item. 
Passages lead north and south.

&+WThe Emperor's Audience Room&*^
The power of the sun is burning your heart, but you bravely step ahead 
finding yourself in a large hall made for the emperor of this forgotten 
town. The emperor is believed to be the son of the sun God and you have
obviously put your nose into the wrong place. Escape way is back south.

You enter a chamber decorated with paintings of great wars on the walls. 
The warlord earned his eternal home by guarding the city from the mountain 
tribes living south of the city. He also saved the emperor from assasins 
who tried to take his life, after the priests had predicted the devastation.
The only exit is to the south.

Some of the tales show how the son of the sun God let some of his most 
faithful subjects follow him to this desperate escape from the destruction. 
There are doorways in every direction.

The emperors' chief astronomer walks these underground caverns. She was the
first one to notice the signs of destruction on the sky years ago. 
Signs of her wisdom and skill can still be found in the deserted town. 
There are calendars and large astronomical maps covering the walls. 
Surprisingly you find your birthday on the calendar - and the day of your 
death! The only way out is to the west.

Saying your prayers every night before you go to bed seems to pay. The walls 
of the room you just entered are covered with silver reflecting the expensive
tastes of the priest living here. The room has no natural light, but two 
burning torches on the south wall are bringing light over the place. The 
exit is to the north.

The natives might like snakes and even worship them, but the snake living 
in this dim cellar doesn't much like you. Its' presence reminds you about
your mortality and makes you consider whether to leave at once or try to
slay that rattling thing before you. You suddenly notice that the floor
is covered with gold items and your natural greed makes you consider the
the matter even harder. The snake, however, is guarding these valuables so
you can't just take them and leave. It might already be too late to escape
back up.

You climb down the stairs and come into a hall which has exits west, south,

you could actually sleep on it. The ceiling is emitting blue light and the 
walls are covered with somewhat extraordinary pictures about the history
of spacetravels.

The wisdom of the universe has been collected on the shelves of this room 
in the form of old books, written centuries ago by wizards and mages who 
reigned these, now so desolated lands. The books have been written in some 
unknown language so you can't share the wisdom with those wizards who died
a long time ago. The owner of the books, however, seems not to have this
problem for the books look as if they have been read through thousands of
times during the preceding centuries.

&+WBlizzard Pass&*^
   You are trudging through deep snow as you follow a narrow track that winds
down a long pass leading ever southward, its end is hidden by the flurries of
snow that are still falling.  On either side of you the mountains tower high
above the pass, their peaks veiled in clouds.  At one point, however, the cliff
is nowhere near as steep and a fair way up a single window has been cut,
looking out across the snows. To the east a snowy path leads among the trees.

   You are lost in a blizzard, almost blinded by the driving snows. The howling
icy wind sends huge clouds of snow whistling across the plain totally obscuring
your view.
   The snows extend in all directions save north, where a lighted inn offers
warmth, food, and shelter from the elements.

   You are outside The Gate of Sorcerors.  Its mighty pillars tower up around
you, shielding you from the worst of the snow that is falling and from some of
the icy winds.  The ancient arched gateway between the pillars leads north into
a wide magically lit passage which disappears into the roots of the earth.
   You may enter the gate to the north, a lighted inn to the east, or trudge
south into the snows.

Heavy snow is falling all around you partially hiding the distant mountains in
clouds of whiteness.
   The snows extend in all direction save east, where the crevasse bars the
route.  You could clamber down into the crevasse but would have great problems

stream, but thins out to the north and west where paths lead off.

Racks of unfinished weapons and armor fill the room, while one entire
wall is taken up by the massive forges used by the castle armorers in
the pursuit of their craft. The heat here is incredible, and you

ripples as a draft moves the cloth, and it seems to you that it is
almost alive, ready to spring down from it's perch to defend it's master.

the portraits, you can see honor and chivalry in their eyes. All but
one. The painting of Mordred is as realistic as the others, and from
his eyes you see only a cold calculating evil.

Perhaps so, but should there not be more defenses? Could King Arthur be

What a place! People are standing in lines just to give their money
to other people who are sitting in little cages. On the wall is a
sign which reads "Camelot Royal Employee Depository for Installments
and Taxes". You aren't sure what that means, but you'd sure like to
go sit in one of those cages for awhile!

and nettles prevent you from exiting to the south, but it might be
possible to leave the road on the north side.

Walking into the tavern, you are struck by a feeling of warmth and
comfort. The smell of good food cooking, and the sight of good drink
being passed around makes you long to stay awhile.

been beating them with a hammer while bored. A small tunnel leads

The Great Hall^
You walk down the wide hall, amazed. The walls are paneled with
walnut, and on the walls hang paintings. Looking at them, you see
pictures of Merlin, Rapture, and all their closest friends. The
northern wall is dominated by a painting showing their marriage.

The Dining Hall^
The most prominent item in the room is the table placed in the
middle of the floor. Carved and inlaid with ivory, it could easily
seat 50 guests. The room is lighted by a massive chandelier
suspended above the table.

The Pantry^
Walking through the door, you are struck by the cold air of this
room. Some great magic is at work here, apparently to better
preserve the haunches of beef and venison, the hams, and the other
foods stored here. Moving towards the exit, you realise that the
cold is only intense near the foods. Staying away from them, the
room is at a normal tempurature.

There are several muddy boot racks along the western wall, obviously for
the use of servants who have been working in the gardens beyond.
Various tools for the tending of the garden are stored here, close

The Sitting Room^
This large, plush room is used as a place to sit in the quiet and
meet with visitors. There is a sense of quiet, of privacy, that
makes you feel quite comfortable. The floor is heavily carpeted,
and your steps make no sound. And no sounds penetrate from the
world outside either.

Under The Stairs^
This small room, tucked under the staircase, seems to be intended
as the entry to the cellars below the castle. Though the rooms
below are lit by torches, still you feel uneasy at the thought og
entering without an invitation.

in. The rest of the room is filled with chairs, couches, and

Second Floor Landing^
This level of the Keep seems to be devoted to living quarters for
guests. Exits North, East, and West lead to rooms, while a balcony
lies south. Above you lies the entrance to Merlin private
apartments. A glance up the stairs shows that it is well guarded,
and probably not a wise place to intrude.

orders to kill anyone who ignores the warnings and enters here, you
are quickly executed.

oddly, when you looked at the Keep from outside, they seemed to be
made of solid stone. The floor is covered by a thick carpet, and
the room is filled with rare flowering plants. There are several
lounge chairs around the room, and on a small table by one is a
vase of white roses.

Bathing Room^
You are in what could easily be the most luxurious bathing room you
have ever heard of. The walls and floor are of white marble. The
floor is warmed to a comfortable tempurature by some magic. In the
center of the room is a huge sunken tub. Water flows continually in
and out of it, and the steam rising from it makes you long to immerse
yourself. Along the western side of the tub is a shelf holding
bottles of various soaps, oils, and lotions. A small stand holds a
stack of thick, soft towels.

This is where Merlin comes for privacy when he needs to build some
new trap for mortals who invade his home. The walls are covered
with maps of all of AberMUD, with notations on them describing the
various traps and puzzles, and their solutions. A large table fills
the floor, and is covered with maps and diagrams for areas that are
currently under construction.

philters, retorts and alembics. And the remains of a few monsters
which didn't quite work right and are being recycled (Merlin may
kill people, but he is always mindful of the ecology).

which are placed on so many of these items.

of a hyena, his chest is rather canine in form, his feet are paws,
and his hands are clawed. He is thin to the point of being
skeletal, and his only body hair is a putrid yellow crest running
to mid-back. His skin is dead gray, and his amber eyes glow evilly
in the darkness.

The furniture in this room seems to be slightly less opulent then
in other parts of the Keep, as if it was selected more for comfort
then for style or appearances. A large stone fireplace is set into
the north wall, and the furniture is arranged around it, so that
all guests will be comfortable and at a conversational distance.

The walls are of white marble, and the floor is covered by a thick
white rug, made from some sort of fur. The draperies over the

single item of furniture takes up almost all available floor space.

Huge rocks at the bottom offer the delights of total oblivion, to become just
another smashed wreck at its base.
   If you are in no hurry, a narrow cliff path also leads down to the north
descending down a fissure in the cliff itself.
   To the south a path runs towards a large castle with a threatening black
tower, while to the west is an old watchtower.

west.

archway, which looks out northwards across the courtyard, its high thick walls
silhouetted in the torch light.

tell that they have been in use recently.
   A strong wind gusts through the open doorway to the west.

&+WEscape Passage&*^
   This is a passageway which would be used by the King and his court if the
castle defense was ever penetrated, to escape from the attackers, and looking
at the lack of dust and cobwebs it would seem to have been used recently.  The
passage is small and dark, but probably more inviting than the wrong end of a
sword.

&+WKitchens&*^
   You are standing in the large kitchens for the castle where the daily feasts
were prepared for court.  The place is now in disarray, with tables and cooking
utensils scattered all over the floor.  Exits lead east, or down some stairs
into the cellar.

   You are in a large and dry store room for the food and drink needed to keep
the King happy.  It seems to have escaped the attention of the attackers, as
the stores are intact, but out of reach.   A set of narrow steps lead up.

&+WTorture Chamber&*^
   You are standing in a pleasant torture chamber which would appear to have
been in regular use as not a single implement lies rusted.  Many implements of
torture lie about the room with various pieces of anatomy still attached to
some of them.
   A single doorway leads west.

   You find yourself in the guard room for the castle.  Bunks line the walls,
and weapon racks stand in the center of the room, though they are all empty
now.  Judging by the upturned tables and chairs and the dried blood on the
floor you think that the guards may not have left on a Sunday afternoon stroll.
   A single narrow doorway leads east.

crypt.  Low moaning sounds echo from within the catacombs before you, sending
chills up your spine.

into darkness, while cool air blows in from the relative safety of the church

There is an archway leading south.
There is a heavy wooden door, made of cedar and overlayed with gold, at the

Small Church^
   Inside the church, you look down a short aisle at the simple altar, its
altarpiece &+Cilluminated &+Wbrilliantly&* by the &+Ylight&* from its small clerestory
windows above your head. Though tiny, this church has a spiritual quality to
it that is quite refreshing. By the altar sits a plate for donations.

Path to the &+RCathedral&*^
   As you step onto the path, you see a towering giant to the east. 
The cathedral rises high into the air, its twin towers soaring above even the 
&+Lstorm&* clouds which brew overhead, and add an air of &+ggloom&* to the place. Strong
winds lash at your flesh, urging you away. A wall of &+Gbushes&* looms to the south.

   The &+Gbushes&* to the north are cut away, allowing your safe passage, to the
south this path continues around the tower. The &+Gbushes&* around you protect 
you from the buffeting winds of the &+Lstorm&* above.

Side Door^
   The &+Csky&* above seems lighter here, and the winds fade. you are surrounded
by walls of &+Ggreen&* on all sides but north. In that direction, surrounded by
the &+givy&* that crawls all about the sides of the cathedral, is a heavy &+ywooden&* 
door, with a quite substantial lock of a type you've never seen the likes of.

Trap Door^
   As you exit the cathedral, the door slams shut, and its heavy bolts fall
into place. You can hardly see a thing through the thick &+Wfog&*. Wraithlike
forms swoop down at your head making you duck in terror.  You can fight them,
but it is unlikely you can budge the door, should you survive the battle.

The &+YRoyal&* Portals^
   The Western Facade of the Cathedral looms up before you into the &+Wmisty
&+Csky&*. A triad of grand portals lie before you. Each is flanked by monolithic
jamb statues, sculptured figures which stand flat against the architecture, 
and watch over the portals to this mighty cathedral. You are struck by the 
malign expressions on their faces, for they look much more like grinning 
&+Rdevils&* than the holy figures one would expect to find at the doors of a mighty
church.

The South Portal^
   As you step forward into the &+Ldarkness&* of the portal, you realize it has
been boarded over with &+ywood&*. You try to budge the old and &+Lrotting &+yboards&*,
but to no avail. You will have to try another way in.

The Central Portal^
   This is the grandest of the three portals. Overhead you can barely make
out the details of its bizarre tympanum sculpture. Above the door, in a half
moon shaped area enclosed by a pointed arch, is a sculpture of an enthroned
man, hooded and wearing a flowing cape which is tattered at the ends. His
arms are outstretched and underneath them, smaller figures writhe in agony, 
as tiny swirling demons whip around their heads and torment them mercilessly.
The Door itself is heavily boarded, and though it looks worn and battered,
the &+ywood&* holds firm at any attempt to force your way through.

The North Portal^
   You step into the &+Ldarkness&* of the portal, and to your surprise the way to
the east appears clear, though it leads into complete &+Ldarkness&*. The jamb
statues here are the most hideous of all. Their heads are mere skulls, some
of which display gaping cracks, thier feet rest upon what appear to be the
artists rendition of bodies &+ydecaying&*.

Perhaps you will appreciate the messages in sculpture more in the afterlife.
As you look on from above, the figures on the portal pack themselves more 
tightly together, and another figure, shaped like you, with a split skull
for a head, emerges from the marble wall to join them.

The Spiral Stairs^
   These stairs seem to spiral up endlessly, and you wonder if you have gone
so high as to rise above even the &+Lstorm&* which is brewing above the cathedral.
As you finally approach the top, a great &+Ylight&* shines down upon you which 
seems to answer your question, that in fact you have climbed a very long way.

&+Wwhite silk&* interior. A vase of &+Rroses&* sits upon the windowsill.

   The stairs are rickety and worn with age, but they seem secure enough to
support your weight. There appear to be no windows in this tower, as you
cannot make out any &+Ylight&* from above. At the top the stairs emerge into a
small unlit room.

everything, and a &+gmusty&* smell fills your nostrils.

The Nave^
   You stand at the beginning of the long nave of the cathedral, which
stretches out a great distance to the east. The triforiums run along the
northern and southern sides, with great columns of polished &+Wwhite&* marble 
soaring upward into &+Ldarkness&* to support the vaulted ceiling, which is only
barely visible. The clerestory windows are blocked off by the &+Lstorm&* raging
outside, and no light passes through. To your north, through a high arch,
lies the northern tower. Likewise, to the south, there is another tower.
To the west the royal portals appear to be boarded up, but the nave continues
to the east.

the side aisles through any of the archways between the columns. To the west 
the nave continues toward the royal portals. To the east it leads toward the 
choir and the apse. Several chairs, broken and battered, are strewn about the 
floor.

   The walls to the west and north are made of huge blocks of marble, stained
by centuries of &+bgrime&* and &+gfungi&*. The wall to the north is interrupted by a
large &+ywooden&* door, with metal handles. The door is swung back, and beyond it
you can make out only &+Ldarkness&*. Howling sounds reach your ears from beyond
the doorway. To the east the aisle continues.

&+Yheaven&* can no longer shine in, and the place takes on an air of &+bgloom&* matched
by few places you have ever been in. The columns to the north and south seem
to tower menacingly over you. Through these columns lie the side aisle which
runs along the nave. To the east is the crossing bay, and to the west the nave
continues toward the portals.

   Long ago crowds lined up along this aisle, waiting to see the holy relics
housed in the east end of the cathedral. Now the mosaic paintings they once
appreciated while they waited are in disrepair. Tiles litter the floor, and

The Crossing Bay^
   This is the crossing bay, where the nave and the transept cross. The
transept hall lies to the north and south. To the east the nave continues
through the choir and toward the apse. A fountain sits here, burbling. As
you peer down into the fountain, you notice it runs &+Rred&* with &+rblood&*, rather
than &+Wclear &+Bwater&*, and yet it looks strangely tantalizing.

lie desolate mountains, and above you &+Lstorm clouds&* roll, and &+Wlightning&* arcs
down in the distance.

your footsteps have awakened.

choir, and at the end of the long nave, you see the altar where patrons used
to pray. It stands before you in shameful condition. Huge chunks of shaped 
marble litter the floor, remnants of a grand sculptured altarpiece, now in 
ruin. Behind the altar lies a monstrous wallpainting. Seering &+Rred &+Beyes&* gaze 
down upon you hatefully, and wide grinning mouths show pointed teeth and drip 
&+rblood&*, under a &+Rreddish&*-&+Mpurple &+Csky&*.

never made it here since according to the Priest he was killed by the vampire,
and the cathedral turned into a &+rdemonic &+blair&*.

&*Hall of &+LArmor^
   The walls of this room are made up of cubicles, each containing a suit
of armor and a small plaque describing it. It looks much like a museum 
exhibit.

around in the void long enough, perhaps you'll find something.

Hall of Weapons^
   The floor here is smoothly tiled, as is the high ceiling. Racks line the
walls, and upon the racks sit weapons of all types from all places and times.
Whomever built this place seems to have a fascination for collecting fine
things, or perhaps he just gets bored living for all eternity, and collecting 
gives him a purpose. A piercing stench rises from the south.

Hall of &+RCarnage&*^
   You nearly lose your lunch as you enter this place. Stinking &+yrotting&* flesh
lines the floor, ceiling, and walls. bodies in various stages of &+Ldecay&* line
the place. The floor is covered in a thick layer of &+Rreddish &+rooze&*, which must
be the same stuff which is dripping slowly onto you from above.

&+RCarnage &+LHall&*^
   Row upon row of chairs stretch out around you, and a tiny faraway stage
commands your attent...  Oh.. thats Carnagie Hall.. My mistake...

   You stand among more of the same decaying mess as you see to the north.
An exit to the west looks slightly more inviting.

&+LCrypt Entrance&*^
   The walls here are made up entirely of hideous snarling gargoyles. The
dark &+Lgrey&* stone is damp and &+Bcold&* to the touch. You feel a &+Cchill&* set in that 
goes straight to your bones. Exits lead north and south, but you wonder if 
it isn't better to turn tail and run back to the east. The outline of a door
marks the wall to the west. No handles or other markings appear on the wall.

   As you step in, you nearly trip, as the floor is not too solid. You notice
that the floor here is one big mattress. The room itself is dome-shaped.
Piles and piles of pillows of all shapes and sizes line the walls. There is
a small door in the west wall.

The Library^
   This is LeSuorac's private library. Here you see shelf upon shelf of fine 
volumes. As you browse you notice the works of Anne Rice have a prominent
place in this library. In the corner is a copy machine, but it doesn't
accept change, only those silly little copy cards.

The &+rVampire's &+LCrypt&*^
   The walls here alternate between towering engaged corinthian columns and
flat surfaces of marble brickwork. Flowing red velvet drapery falls between 
the columns. High above, shrouded in mist, is the single groin-vault that
forms the ceiling of this crypt. Your breath echoes off the walls, disturbing 
the solitude that this chamber provides. The space is dominated by a platform
upon which rests a lone sarcophagus.

crudely built of blocks of &+Lstone&*, and you have to duck down just to stand.

looks bare and empty and is one of those rooms which have no real reason to

design, with a massive fan-vaulted ceiling.  The spectacular arches and pillars
are all decorated with dwarvish battle scenes and, high up, dwarven momentos of
great age are hung, golden banners, shining axes, helms, and many other items
of war and craft.
   High arched exits lead north, east and south, a set of narrow stairs leads
down into the cellars, and a wide sweeping staircase leads up to a high balcony
overlooking the hall.

down, attempting to put you off your food.

which leads north, beside a stone wall.  To the south is the churchyard, and
the old church itself.  To the west a worn rut in the grass leads out across
some marshy ground, past a sign which reads "Danger Marshland".

   You are standing in a small dark room, beneath the northern barrow.  All
around you lie the relics of an ancient time, crumbling slowly into dust.
Everything is dark and creepy, and the sense of malice and foreboding makes you
jump at the slightest movement in the shadows.  The center of the room is a
tall gravestone bearing the words:
   "White The Wizard - A man pledged never to make his own coffee."

   You are on a steep path that leads up and down the mountain, with snow
lashing you from all sides. Above you you can make out some sort of stone
structure, while below you see the beginnings of a large forest. To the
northeast you see what may be smoke rising above the trees.

   You are in a small clearing. To your south is a path through the forest
surrounded by trees. To the north of you is a giant iron gate, and on each 
side of the gate is a wall stretching out for miles.  Looking through the gate 
you can kind of make out a small town.  The gates look very large and heavy.

Road to Town^
   You are on a road that leads to the north and south through a lifeless
forest. You notice the flowers on the side of the road are dead and seem to 
have been trampled on. To the north you can see a town and notice that there 
are no houses, but little huts instead.  You can see that a lot of the huts 
have been burned down or are damaged as if there had been a fire here.  The 
road leads north to the town, or south to a large and heavy set of gates that 
lead through a long wall. To the east you see a small wooden shack through 
the trees.

A Wooden Shack^
   This shack appears to have not been used in a long time. You notice that 
it is very messy and has a strong musty smell to it. There is a table in the 
middle of the room that has scraps of old cut up fish on it. On the east 
wall is an old rocking chair, the chair looks unused and has collected a lot 
of dust. There are a lot of cracks in the ceiling and walls, letting dim,
diffuse light into the room.

   You are standing at the entrance to a small town.  There are a lot of old 
shacks around you, although many of them are not standing anymore.  You 
notice a pleasant-looking shack to the west; is doesn't look as dirty as the
rest of the shacks that are still standing.  To the north you see that the
forest closes back in on the town, while to the south you can see a gate in
the distance.

   You are in a large, tidy, and nice-smelling one room shack. There is a 
nice sized dinner table in the middle of the room with a white cloth over 
the it.  An old iron stove sits against the north wall.  The shack is nicely 
decorated with paintings hanging from walls and resting on shelves around the 
room. There is a door to the east that leads out to the town road, and to the 
west a door goes out to a large yard.

   You are in a large and nicely maintained yard which appears to be the
nicest place in town that you have seen. There is a small pond set in the 
middle of the yard, with arranged groupings of flowers and bushes that 
surround giant trees. You hear the sounds of birds and other animals here
that you have noticed to be absent elsewhere in the forest. This is the only 
nice place in town that you have seen so far. To the east you can enter the
shack.

   The forest to the north looks very thick and dark.  The road you are 
standing on is narrower here than to the south, and it gets even narrower to
the north. The dirt here looks like ashes, and there is a smell in the air
of rotting flesh. There is a large shack to the east or you can go north 
or south on the town road.

   You walk into a large bar. This seems to be where most of the people are,
for the bar is very crowded. There are people sitting at tables having 
drinks, talking, and people dancing on the dance floor. There are a bunch of 
drunks on the stage trying to dance, but they are stumbling and laughing too 
hard to do so. You notice one guy sitting at the bar by himself with a 
strange look on his face, maybe you should talk to him.

   You enter a path in the woods. It is dark and very creepy. You can barely 
see the path, only enough to know where to put your feet. You feel like 
you're being watched and looking around you realize the trees have horrible 
faces carved on them.  The path leads to the east where there is a little 
more light, and to the south where it passes a large shack.

the light that is spilling out through the open doorway of the shack. The

much in here though.  A large dinner table sits in the middle of the room 
with broken plates and scraps of food on it.  Whoever was eating here was a 
slob.  There is a stairwell leading down a flight of VERY old looking stairs.

You notice a strange light and can hear the death cries from children and 
adults coming from inside this place. You can go east back down the road, 
or to your west is a door leading into the house. There are carvings on the 
ground in front of you.

   You are in the cold damp basement of the house.  There are corpses 
littering the floor and the smell down here is horrible.  You would not want 
to stay down here for too long. You notice there are bats roosting in the 
rafters above you. A set of heavy stone stairs lead up to the main floor.

The Old Stairs^
   You make it about half way down the stairs, when suddenly a step breaks from 
under you.  The rotted foundation of the shack breaks and splinters under 
your weight, impaling you through the abdomen.  

   Suddenly you don't feel very well...

&+WGrassy Hillock&*^
	Sights and scents of the meadowlands assault you as you stand on top
of a low-rolling hill covered in grasses and field plants.  Looking around,
you see the rolling hills flatten out as it descends to the east, where a
blue-white haze of the horizon hints at a coastline.  The trail you stand
on appears more beaten to the east, a small climb up a rocky slope to the
west looks possible, and an inviting meadow is to your south.  You nearly
overlook an almost abandoned trail to the north.

	You stand amid a sea of yellow-flowered buttercups, giving this place
an aura of golden beauty, making you squint from the brightness.  Colorful
butterflies and birds flit by, giving this place a sense of vibrant life
and beauty.  The golden sea appears to end to the east, where a sharp cliff
drops off to the dull sound of crashing water, and to the west leads a
beaten trail into an area of grassy hills.  To the south, you see the hills
flatten out to a large field, with what looks like sheep in the distance.

&+WEastern Cliff Top&*^
	At least eighty feet below you stands jagged rocks, deadly spires of
teeth that could kill any who are foolhardy enough to jump from here.  Even
if a lucky sole misses the rocks, then surely the waves will be the end of
them, crashing and whipping into the rocks with uncontrolled fury.  Safer
grounds lie to the west, where a haze of yellow brilliance arises, and to
the south toward a high point at the cliff's end, but a thrill-seeking
trail cuts a rut into the cliff face to the rocks below for those that are
not too encumbered.

&+WUp the Coastal Cliff&*^
	Scrabbling for a foothold, you stop for a moment, and look through
the misty air to see treacherous rocks far enough below you to make a jump
a futile effort of survival.  The only sound you hear is the dull and
thunderous sounds of the waves crashing into the rocks below.  A thick mist
envelops the air around you, obscuring the surroundings and making the
rocks here slippery to the touch, but you can discern footholds safe enough
to climb up the face of the cliff, and a slightly (but not by much) safer
path, only a crack in the rock, leading down near the rocks below.

	Mist condenses on your face as you gaze upon the frothy waters around
you.  Not much can be seen of the sea, with all the mist and the tall
jagged rocks, some towering fifteen feet in the air.  Turning around you
see a virtually unclimbable cliff, save for a crack that runs up diagonally
along the face.  The beach continues to the south.

	This part of the shore narrows to the point where the distance
between the surf to the west and the sheer face of the cliff looming
overhead to the east is only a scant few feet, and occasionally you need to
walk in ankle-deep water just to continue.  To the north and the south are
walkable stretches of beach while the waters to the east offer little more
than a watery grave.

	Small rocks and pebbles intermingle with the sands of the beach here,
making you check your steps, lest you slip.  The cliff appears to drop off
to the south from here, and you can investigate further by following the
beach to the south, or to follow the increasingly narrowing coast to the
north.

ninety feet above you, but from the perspective, it might be higher.
Seagulls fly about nearby, occasionally giving a shrill call to their
brethren.The cliff here bends off toward the north, cradling a narrow
beach, and also falls off to the west, where a path rises over a sandy hill
and out of sight.

	You are half climbing, half slipping on the stones and dirt of a
steep path climbing the side of an escarpment.  From here, you can see a
expanse of swampland to the south, and to the east you can see a blue sea
stretching out.  Looking back to the dreariness of your surroundings, the
path appears to continue above you, heading near some old castle walls, and
down into the murky swamplands below.

&+WBase of the Escarpment&*^
	You are standing at a drier spot in the swamplands, seemingly
impervious to the thick plant growth.  Looking around, you see that most of
the ground here consists of hard rocks and pebbles that have fallen down
from a nearby gully up the cliff, making it hard for plants to root in.  A
path hugs the cliff, but still uncomfortably close to the swamps to the
east, which for some strange reason makes your skin crawl.  A break in the
twisted trees lie to the south, and it looks as if you could scrabble
through the pebbles up the side of the escarpment.

&+WNorth Swamplands&*^
	This part of the swamp seems too close for comfort, and you think the
plants and brambles are creeping in on the thinning path against the cliff
side.  The path looks more comforting to the west, where a clearing appears
to be, and also to the east where the path rises above the stunted
treetops.

	You feel little comfort here as the path lies mere feet from the
first of the swampland trees, unearthly twisted representations of plants,
giving you a feeling of hopeless despair.  The path looks even more dreary
to the west as it slopes gradually down to the level of the swamps itself,
but a more promising path lies upwards to the east, where there appears to
be a cavemouth in the tall cliff face.

indented crevice in the main cave room itself.  Somewhat inclined from the
floor, you see many animal furs scattered about the small space, and on a
small ledge, you see various personal articles of the Trapper, most of
which look useless or not to your liking at all.  The only obvious exit
from here is south back into the main cave.

this is the humble residence of the Trapper, with all the piles of useless
traps lying nearby in a corner.  From here, you spy a darker niche in the
northern end of the cave, while to the east is a dark hole that your light

&+WCarved Store Room&*^
	This small room seems to you a recent addition of the Trapper's, with
rough edges still in the rock walls, and even bits of freshly chipped stone
still  littering the floor.  This room was apparently made to store all the
Trapper's rapidly growing piles of semi-useless equipment and other
necessities.  The only exit from here is through a small carved hole to the
west.

&+WAt the Cave Entrance&*^
	The path here rises up and you find yourself looking down into the
murky swamp, wishing that you didn't.  A vast expanse of dark and demented
plant growth, you feel some dreadfully evil influence has been the cause of
this.  In the face of the cliff here is recessed a cave, where within, you
can only discern blackness, though you spy some boot prints leading in and
out of the cave, evidence that someone resides here.  A smell emanates from
the cave, reminding you of some old stale bread and musty animal skins.  To
the east and west, the path continues to thread its way along the base of
the cliff.  Looking again into the swamp, as if your eyes are drawn there,
you spy a glimmer of gold in the dark murk, but before you can blink to
clear your vision, the bright spot is gone.  The path leads off at a
descending slope to the east and west, and a smaller trail leads south,
toward a small grassy glade.

&+WGrassy Glade&*^
	This is a small meadow that appears to not have been affected by the
stunting effects of the swamp.  Though you feel comforted in seeing such a
peaceful looking place, you also feel the eerie feeling of the swamp just
beyond a shock of tall, impenetrable looking brambles.  To the north leads
a small path that appears to head up sharply toward a small black hole in
face of the cliffs.  A grassy path turns into a sandy trail as it descends
toward a small lagoon to the east, and to the south, you see a stream
across the soft grass.

&+WGentle Beach&*^
	Soft sand underfoot, the moth-like licking of the waves upon the
surf, and the cool sea breeze are the meanest things that assault you as
you tread this lonely beach.  The water at this end of the coast is ringed
in by a perimeter of sharp rocks, supposedly brought in some time in the
past to break the tortuous waves beyond, and it in effect creates a calm
lagoon.  You see a tall cliff loom up from the north, the beach leading up
to a sharp west-north bend.  A bleak-looking stream lets out a little ways
to the south, just north of a line of more tide-breaking stones.
The cool, refreshing waters seem to beckon to you, to join in the knee-
deep waters to the east.

	Standing to your knees in cool and refreshing water, you feel relaxed
from the toils and rigors of the land, and you inhale the invigorating sea-
scented air blowing in from the sea.  At your feet underwater, you see
through the ripples many colorful corals, starfish, mollusks, and other
marine life.  Large rocks ring the waters here, breaking the waves of the
sea beyond.  The beach lies to the west.

&+WOutside the Swamps of Peril&*^
	This area appears to be the only break in the brambles and dense and
twisted vegetation to allow entrance eastward into the swamp, at least for
those that are brave and staunch enough to venture further.  You hear
strange sounds coming from inside the swamp, making your blood cold.  The
stream here smells fetid and vile, as if foul substances were dumped into
it.  You would feel much more comfortable if you headed back east along the
stream.

&+WBeside the Stream&*^
	Walking on a grassy bank, you peer into an east-west running stream
as it drains out of a dreary looking swamp to the west.  The water, instead
of containing the vibrant life of plants and water life, bears the smelly
slimes, fetid algae, and uncleanliness of whatever dwells from within the
dark swamp, causing your nose to wrinkle.  The stream looks no more than
waist-deep, but any travel to the south bank appears futile, with a
formidable wall of thorny bramble bushes to meet you there.  More hopeful
paths lie to the east, where the stream thins out into the sea, and to the
north across a grassy field.  To the west, you see another, less traveled
path following the stream toward the edge of the swamp itself.  Such
feelings leave you to think that travelling into the swamp would not be a
good idea.

&+WMouth of the Stream&*^
	At this part of the beach, you see a stream come in from the west and
empty its dark and rancid waters into the sea, and you get a strange
feeling that the waters of the sea feel repulsed at what is emptying into
it from the stream.  Few if any plants seem to conglomerate at the stream's
edge, and how sickly and twisted the ones are that live there.  You can
follow the shoreline to the north, to a more welcoming beach, or follow the
stream to the west, or you can try crossing the stream here and approach a
line of wave-breaking rocks that lie nearby to the south.

&+WIn the Brambles&*^
	You are beating your way through a dense clump of thorny foliage, and
think that this was not really the best idea, since the plants seem to have
a mind of their own and appear to tear into your exposed flesh whenever you
think you've moved it out of the way, or prick you in the most sensitive
areas.  Safer ways of travel lie to the east and south, but to the north
and east, you might just be able to escape the thorny overgrowth by
plunging on through headlong.

&+WOn the Rocks&*^
	You carefully pick your way among large boulders lined in an east-
west line, going out about forty feet from the shore, obviously built by
past inhabitants to break the dangerous waves that come into the beach.
From here, you can see paths following the beach to the north and south,
and you can go inland by walking west toward a patch of thorny brambles, or
by following a steep path up a sandy dune.  If you are careful, you can
make your way east out to the end of the rocks.

&+WEnd of the Rock Bank&*^
	You precariously stand on a slanted rock here, overlooking the beach
nearby.  Waves crash around the rocks here, spraying them and you with cold
water, and making the rocks increasingly slippery, making even walking a
telling task, let alone anything more theatrical.  To the north you spy
another row of rocks, and to the south, you see a small dock jut into the
water.  The only survivable way out of here appears to be back along the
wet rocks to the west.

&+WSandy Dunes&*^
	You stand along a ridge of sandy dunes that run parallel to the beach
that lies to the east, the waves of the sea crashing in where the beach
breakers fail to cover, and apparently on a sand shoal resting some hundred
feet from shore as well.  From this vantage, you spy to the north a long
wall of cliffs, and in front of that to the west, a dark green-black mass
that is only known as the Swamps of Peril.  To the south, you observe a
long beach leading back to a small set of docks.  The sides of the dunes
appear too steep to climb back down except for the west side and a quick
tumble down toward a line of wave breaking rocks.

	The sand here feels soft at your feet and the water splashing up from
the sea feels exhilaratingly cool.  A brisk breeze from the east blows in
from the great sea, blowing at your hair.  You can follow the sandy shore
to the north and south, and to the west you see a steep bank of a long sand
dune.

	Foamy water laps hungrily at your calves and knees as you stand here
in shallow water some thirty feet east from the shoreline.  Not much can be
seen from here except a line of rocks extending out into the sea to the
north and a small boating dock to the south.  It seems that the water waves
are breaking too far from the shore than normal, hinting at a sand shoal to
the east, but you are not sure if you could reach it.  More accessible
routes appear to lie back toward the shore and farther south along the
shallows.

creating frothy waves that crash into the surf.  The beach continues to the
north, where you see a rock outcropping that goes a short distance into the
sea.  To the east you notice that a little dip in the water is not
impossible since the water appears somewhat shallow.

	With water up to your waist here, you feel tingles run up your spine
from the contact with the cool and refreshing sea water.  A brisk breeze
blows in from the sea, tinged with salt.  Gulls and other sea-faring birds
fly overhead, circling and turning in some strange dance of the sea.  Not
too far away to the south, you spy a jetty poking its way into the wavy
waters.  Noticing the shallow waves, you see the cause in the form of a
sand shoal to the east.  Unfortunately, the water gets too deep before you
could get to it without special means.  Looking for exits, you see a way
back to the beach to the west, and it also seems possible to walk north,
following the shallow waters.

&+WDreamer's Point&*^
	This is the famous point of that man, the Dreamer, who made this high
corner of the cliff the popular place that it is.  From here, you can see
for miles around.  To the east and running along toward the south as far as
the eye can see, the great sea stretches out to the horizon, its blue
waters drawing your eyes hypnotically.  You see islands out in the distant
water, but can only imagine what they are like.  To the south you see a
flat lowlands, dominated by a dark mass of trees, the Swamps of Peril.
Outlining the swamp is a long beach, running up to the cliff foot directly
under you, and then splitting off, one trail continuing north up the beach,
and the other disappearing out of view to the west.  A range of mountains
line the valley far to the west and southwest, and nestled in front of the
range directly to the west is an old and eroding castle, with one black
tower still defiantly standing.  A path leading north is the only way out
of this narrow cliff corner.

&+WHills of Grass&*^
	Walking on the cushiony grasses, you find yourself on one of the many
hills that roll off into the distance.  Travelling here could become easily
disorienting because of rolling effect the hills create.  You feel relieved
to see marked trails leading off to the north and south.

&+WRolling Meadow&*^
	Grassy hills roll off into the distance here as you walk by, and you
smell the fragrances of the wild grasses and flowers growing all around.
The hills flatten out to a large field to the west, where you hear the
bleating of sheep.  Another path to the south makes a easterly turn along a
cliff edge.

	The loamy smell and plaintive sound of bleating sheep is the first
thing you notice as you walk down into this large flat field.  Hills frame
the north and the west, the ground appears to drop off beyond a fence to
the south, and to the east, a modest but welcoming cottage making this
place look like the idyllic scene of pastoral harmony.

	This is the sparse and simple home of the shepherd, a little too
simplistic for an adventurer of your tastes, but obviously adequate to the
shepherd.  A table with two chairs rests against the eastern wall, a window
over the table showing more rolling hills outside.  A simple straw bed lies
to the south, a stone hearth to the north, and an exit back outside lies to
the west.

&+WSouthern Edge of Cliff&*^
	South of the rolling hills, you overlook from a cliff edge the
lowlands of the swamps looming some two hundred feet below you to the
south.  Lucky for you, a sturdy looking fence is between you and the ground
far below the cliff.  Even with the fence, doing anything gymnastic would
be foolhardy.  You can follow the cliff edge to the east, or follow a
westward path wending its way to some hills.

field where sounds of bleating sheep originate, and to the west you can
follow the cliff's edge.

	You follow a winding path in the low bends around rolling hills, and
quickly lose track of progress.  The plants here, living on more rocky
soil, are not as varied and rich as the ones that you see to the south.
The hills are tall here, giving you little view of the land around you.
The only promising routes lie between two hills to the north, where the
path starts to cut into a large and rocky third hill, and to the south up
an even larger hill.

	You walk to the north end of the shoal, the salty water mere inches
deep here.  The shoal breaks the waves up here, making them less fierce
against the beach that lies some eighty feet to the west.  You see various
fish and marine life being washed along by the waves, and some larger
aquatic denizens making waves of their own.  The water appears too
treacherous and deep in all directions save to the south.

&+WOn a Sandy Shoal&*^
	You step up onto a shallow sand shoal, some eighty to ninety feet
east of the shoreline.  Looking at the ankle-deep water here, you discover
that the waves are broken somewhat by the shoal, since you are only swaying
in your steps at each wave instead of floundering head over heels.  The
water is noticeably colder here, giving hint that any travelling farther
east would not only be dangerous due to the waves and sea creatures, but
also to the exposure of the cold water.  You can follow the shoal to the
north and south, or back to toward the west, since the water looks much
shallower here.

	You are more than a hundred feet from shore as you reach this end of
the sand shoal.  Luckily, the water is still no more than ankle deep, but
in all directions but north, the water is too deep to safely traverse
without aid, and even then, the waters to the west look impossibly
traversable.  You feel something slimy and smooth brush your leg, and it
makes you start thinking that staying longer might not be the best of
survival instincts.

	You find yourself brushing the dirt off your clothes as you take
stock of the situation.  This pit appears to have been carefully dug out,
and carefully laid over with sticks and covered in stones, save for the
hole that you fell through.  You try to leap for a handhold at the top, but
hopelessly cannot find anything in reach,  showing you that this pit was
built to hold much larger creatures.  Small rodents and other land-dwelling
animals are here, but all starved to death.  Obviously the last time that
the trapper checked this trap was quite some time.  You just hope that he
remembers to today...

   You stand at the entrance of what was once a grand elven forest.  Now, it
lies in ruins about you.  Blackened stumps abound and the trees which still
stand reek of decay.  This secluded vale has obviously been destroyed by some
great disaster.  You are overcome by a sense of foreboding! The evil which
ruined this forest may still be around!
   Although deeply disturbed by the destruction around you, you manage to look
about to determine your position.  To the North and East are the mountains
which shield this valley.  The area to the South of you also heads into
mountains, but a path makes passage possible.  An archway marks a tunnel
through the eastern mountains.

not for the memory of the tainted forest to the south, you could become easily
lost in the beauty here.  Just to the East of you, partially hidden by healthy
trees, is a small cottage.  To the North and West are the mountains which
seclude this valley.

of the walls, and by the potted plants which hang from the ceiling.  It is

form weird, diabolical shapes, and the area seems pervaded by the stench of
brimstone.  You gag to avoid breathing the fouled air.  To the North and West

did no protect the forest from whatever destroyed it...

   Your heart skips a beat as you enter this grove of trees.  Without a doubt,
this grove used to contain some of the strongest and most beautiful trees in
the entire elven forest.  Now, it looks as though a giant hand came down from
the heavens, and simply pushed the trees down, in a line from West to East.
The few Oaks which still stand have been warped into unhealthy shapes, which
nature itself could never produce.  Following the line of downed trees, you
realize that it leads to a freshly hewn pathway in the mountains to the West.

twisted corpses of the trees seem unnatural.  Somehow, a single oak tree in
the center of the swath of destruction seems to have survived.  It lies just
to the east of you.  To the west, the line of destruction seems to continue.
Mercifully, mountains to the east protected any further realms from this
corruption.

   You gasp out in awe at the quiet beauty of this hidden hollow.  Looking
around, 'majesty' is the word which immediately comes to mind.  The entire
room draws your eyes upwards, like some ancient gothic cathedral. There, among
the arched, wooden roof, are numerous tiny flowers, hanging from the vines
which grow around you. Even in the dim light, the brilliant hues of the
flowers - red, violet, blue, green, and white - stand out. Indeed, they glow
with their own light, providing the majority of the illumination in this room
and sending incredible, multi-colored shadows around the room. As you stare at
them, something tugs at your memory. You have seen that pattern somewhere
before... It is the pattern of the stars in the night sky, but of a color and
brightness that the night sky can only hint at.
   As your eyes slowly refocus on the mundane plane, you notice a wooden
throne set near the middle of this room.  With a start, you realize that is
has been grown from the tree itself.  Once, the whole elven forest must have
been like this...

&+WTainted Trees&*^
   You are in a grove of tall trees which seem tainted.  They glow with a
sickly green glow which speaks of evil, pestilence and disease.  You suppress
a shudder and view your surroundings.  To the south and west lie this forest's
protective mountains, while woods lie to the east.  To the North, a wide swath
of destructions cuts into the heart of this realm.

&+WCorrupted Woods&*^
   You stand in what must have once been a very beautiful grove of trees.  Now,
it has been mutated beyond recognition.  The grotesque shapes of the trees are
all but indescribable.  You get the impression that this forest has been
destroyed by some great, evil force which may still lurk about...

&+WScenic View&*^
   Once, this mountain trail surely was the best place to view the elven
forest.  Now, you can only see the destruction.  To the North and West,
you gaze out at the corrupted, desolate land which was once so beautiful.
Amid the destruction, you see a few points of life.  Just to the Northeast
of you stands a tall, healthy oak tree, while further to the North, you
actually think you see green.  The mountain trail you are on continues North
and South, while a small path leads up from the forest to the West.

&+WRocky Climb&*^
   You are walking on a steep mountain path which leads over the top of the
mountain to the east and downwards towards a ravaged forest to the North.
You suspect that the view here would be quite beautiful if not for the noxious
fumes wafting up from the forest below, which cause your eyes to constantly
water.  Looking at the forest, you believe that it must have once been quite
beautiful.

&+WThorny Path&*^
   You are ascending a path into the mountains, which continues to the North
and South.  The region seems just as desolate as the forest below you.  The
ground is cracked and dying, and the only vegetation is a thorny brush, which
practically cover the path, ripping at your clothes.  The entire Eastern cliff
is covered by a wall of thorns.  On the other side, just to the West is a
sharp dropoff.  Past it, you can see the entire elven forest.  The corrupted
view turns your stomach.

&+WMountain Passage&*^
   You are walking down a long passage which has been carved out of the heart
of this mountain.  It is obvious that great time has been spent carving this
passage.  You have heard rumors of the dwarves of the North cutting a passage
through to a beautiful forest for the elves of this realm.  Perhaps, that
beautiful, fabled realm lies to the West!

&+WFreshly Hewn Pathway&*^
   You stand in a pathway which is quite freshly-hewn.  From the marks made
during the construction of this pathway, it seems that something moved out
into the forest from the west.  To the west, the stench of brimstone is
stronger than ever.

&+WMountain Crest&*^
   You stand at the top of one of the mountains overlooking the valley.  Just
to the east, the path you are on becomes rather precarious, sloping sharply
down into a rocky clearing.  To the west, the descent is more gradual, ending
in a rocky slope.  You should be very careful.  It looks like the area could
all tumble down in a landslide in a second!

&+WGuarded Cave&*^
   You stand at the entrance to a dark cave.  The destroyed forest is behind
you, to the east, while to the west lies the unknown.  Within the cave,
you see dark shadows flittering about.  The scent of brimstone is stronger
than ever here, and the sense of foreboding that you felt when you first
entered the forest clutches anew at you heart.  You have little doubt that
one of the great evils lies within this cave...

&+WEntry Room&*^
   Standing at the entrance to this system of caves, the only description
which comes to mind is 'hellish.'  The caverns glow with a strange red
glow which speaks of nothing more than hellfire.  It almost seems to you that
you can hear the screams of the damned.  A set of stairs leads downwards,
and the heat coming from below almost knocks you out.  Just to the North is
a roughly carved doorway.  Next to the door is a sign which says : Please
check in your souls before entering.

   With a morbid sense of curiosity, you enter the cave where you have been
directed in order to check your soul.  Quite surprisingly, you are not
instantly zapped by some evil being.  Instead, the room seems to a quite
simple coat room.  Lining the walls are coats of every shape and size, checked
in, no doubt, due to the heat below. You would laugh at how ridiculous this
whole scene looked if not for the evil that you feel below you.

&+WGuard Room&*^
   The heat in this room is stifling.  As you struggle to breath the scalding
air, you manage to take in the surroundings.  All about, you can see squalor.
A broken tables lies off to one corner, with the remnants of a meal, ages old
on it, and several broken chairs litter the floor.  The room itself actually
reeks of garbage, and covering the walls are a dried up substance that looks
suspicious like blood.  A crudely letter sign on the wall reads GARD ROME.
To the South is an archway that seems to lead into a somewhat cleaner room.

   This room seems to be somewhat cleaner than the guard room to the North, but
not much.  The same reek of garbage pervades the air, and piles of litter have
been shoved to the sides of the room.  However, in the center of the room is
a wooden pedestal which has been polished to perfection, and which is
exceedingly clean.  You have come through the only entrance to this room.

&+WStairs to Hades&*^
   You have no doubt in your mind that the stairs in the middle of this room
must go down to hell itself.  If you thought the earlier rooms were hot, you
were obviously sadly mistaken.  Here, every breath you take burns your lungs.
Your skin is already beginning to blister from the intense heat, and you are
worried that your clothing may spontaneously combust!  As well, flames appear
in the corners of this room and the smell of brimstone is so strong that it
makes you want to vomit immediately.  Surely, nothing but Hades itself could
lie in the Inferno below...

&+WHot Cavern&*^
   You stand in a huge, natural cavern.  It is not just hot, but rather
almost unbearable.  There certainly better be something valuable down here
to make all of your suffering okay!  To the south of you is another natural
cavern, while to the east lies a passage which is obviously manmade.  Just
to the west is a stone door, set in the wall of the cavern.  A diamond shaped
hole lies in the center of the stone.

statues and paintings, most of which are quite grotesque.  You see sculptures
of demons torturing humans in many gruesome ways, as well as paintings of what
must be Hades.  The whole site is quite sickening.  Doors lead North, East and
South into additional museum rooms, while to the west lies the exit to this
perverted place.

   The entirity of this room is covered by a huge mosaic.  It covers all of
the walls, as well as the ceiling and the floor.  You realize immediately that
the area shown in the mosaic is that which mortals call the wasteland.  You see
images of fire, a sword of awesome power, crystal flame and a great djinni.
For a moment, you almost become lost in the awesome vision.
   Flaming red letters in the center of the room spell out the words, HOME,
SWEET, HOME.

   This part of the Demonic museum seems to be entirely devoted to demonic art.
The pieces are all quite horrific, and there is definitely nothing that would
be valuable to sacrifice to the gods.  You are almost drawn by a morbid
curiosity to look at all of the terrifying pictures.  The only exit out of
this awful place lies to the North.

&+WFungus Cavern&*^
   You are quite delighted to find that this cavern is much cooler than the
surrounding ones.  In fact, the change in temperature is so dramatic that
you begin to shiver uncontrollably.  All about this room are various types of
fungus.  You can make out familiar Toadstools and Mushrooms.  In addition, you
see more much exotic fungus that you have never encountered before.  Perhaps,
you think, you are the only mortal to ever have ventured this far into the
earth. Other natural caverns lie to the North and South.

   Although not as cool as the marvelous fungus cavern, this room is much more
comfortable than the surrounding caves.  In the center of this cavern is a
large lake.  Looking over the walls, you notice strange writing.  To you, it
almost looks like elven writing, somehow corrupted.  Overall, the entire
cavern seems quite gloomy.  You better leave this place before you get real
depressed!

   All throughout this room are paintings of a gruesome undead beast.  Without
a doubt, it must be the Lich who, when fighting Asmodeus, was rumored to have
helped cause the destruction of the elven forest.  The fact that the Lich is
an enemy of the demon lord here is made quite clear by the voice you hear
chanting in your head.  Over and over, you hear 'hate. hate. hate. hate...'

   You have entered another natural cavern.  In the middle of the cavern is a
huge lake.  Indeed, the scene would appear to be quite normal if not for the
fact that lake was actually boiling.  It has become so hot in this room that
water itself is unable to remain in its liquid form!  Surely, you must escape
this demonic realm soon!  Avenues of retreat from here lie to the North and
East.

the room eerie is the fact that no signs of construction are visible.  It is
almost as if the entire room sprung from the earth in its present shape.  To
the South you hear the sounds of liquid boiling, while to the north, beyond
a perfect archway, you see what looks like a throne room.

   You have entered Asmodeus' study.  In the center of the room is a desk,
which you realize is covered with human skin.  Putting that thought out of
your mind you look around the rest of the room.  The walls are made of the
red rock that is common throughout the caves and the smell of sulphur, like
always, all but overwhelms you.  Still, your eyes keep returning to that
gruesome desk.  Looking for exits to this room, you find three.  They lie to
the North, East and South.

   You have entered the throne room of Asmodeus, the Demon Lord who, in his
battle with the evil lich, destroyed the beautiful elven forest.  If that foul
creature is still around, he must be destroyed!  You rapidly glance around the
room and see, in the middle of the room, a throne made out of human bones.
You gag at the sight, and rapidly look for exits from this room.  They lie
to the South and West.

   You realize that this must be what the demonlord calls a bedroom.  It is
little more than a space of level rock in the center of the room.  Asmodeus
obviously worries little about the ordinary comforts of life.  At the least,
this room is not as grotesque as the study that you just passed through.

long hours in here, simply counting his treasures.  You grin evilly at the
thought of stealing from a demon lord.

cool breeze strikes you in the face as you peer ahead into the blackness, and
you sense strong evil emanating from the cavern.  To the west, you see the
blackened mouth of the cave, to the east, a downward sloping passage leads to
darkness.

gargoyles, which seem to be jeering at you.  In the wall far to the north, you
see the black mouth of a passage out, and the room seems to continue to the
east, where dim light can be made out.  To the south, an upward sloping passage
seems to ascend to the surface.

of dust covers everything.  To the north, a passage leads to a small, brightly
lit room.

where, seeming almost alive.  For a moment, you worry that your light source
may be extinguished.  Glancing around, through the inky darkness, you realize
that you are in some type of bed room.  Evil religious icons and grotesque
paintings line the walls.  In the corner sits an altar which is covered by
a dark red liquid.  Without a doubt, this is the home of the Priest of the
dark elves.

&+WTemple Treasury&*^
   You stand in the treasury of this grand dark elven temple.  This side
room is just as beautiful, in its dark, alluring way, as the main worship
room to the east.  Looking around, you are surprised to see that the treasury
is empty!  A note to the side explains that the dark elven Priest has taken
the treasures of the temple for its own 'protection.'

&+WInside the Temple&*^
   You stand just inside the temple of the dark elves.  Looking around, you
realize that it is quite beautiful, even though the beauty seems somehow evil.
You are chilled by a sense of foreboding as you think of what dark acts may
have been committed inside this place of worship, for some nameless evil god.
You see small archways out of this room to the North and West.

&+WDark Elf Temple&*^
   You have emerged into the largest subterranean cavern that you have ever
seen.  Above you, the roof lies somewhere beyond the radius of your light
source, while to the sides of this cavern, you can just barely make out the
walls.  Most astounding is a temple lying in the center of this cavern, which
has apparently been constructed entirely underground!  The temple is made out
of some type of dark stone which glows with an unholy black light.  Without
a doubt, this temple is dedicated to some dark deity.  You may enter it to the
North.  Off to the east and south lie other exits from this cavern.

temple.  It is a rather dark and dreary.  On the ground lie two worn mattresses
while a wobbly table stands to the side.

   You stand in a large, well-kept room.  It has none of the squalor of the
barracks to the East.  There is a neat bed here, with a tidy table next to.
If it weren't for the fact everything in this room was black, the place might
actually look cheery.

   You are in a large barracks for the dark elf troops.  The whole place seems
run down.  Trash litters the floor and most of the beds in this room are
destroyed.  It looks as if, for the most part, the dark elves do not bother
to maintain an army now that their enemies, the good elves above, are gone.
Exits leave these barracks to the West and East.

&+WCavern of the Dark Elves&*^
   You have entered an enormous cavern.  You are awed by the vastness of this
room.  As you acclimate to this dark, damp environment, you remember of the
ancient legends you have heard of a dark race of elves living below the
surface.  Surely, this is their realm!  Looking around you, this assumption
is upheld by the many dark shapes you see moving in the shadows.  You should
move through these realms quickly.  Surely the dark shapes would overwhelm
you by numbers if you stayed here too long.  Exits leave this cavern to the
North, West, South and East, while a ladder leads up.

   You walk down a passage which curves to the West and South.  The passage
is lit by an eerie green glow which seems to come from fungus growth on the
walls.  Ever once in a while, you think you see a dark shape at the edge of
your vision, but then it could just be your imagination.

Besides mushrooms and other common fungus, you also see many unusual ones,
much as in the fungus cavern above.  As well, the green fungus from the
the passageway to the North may be seen.

well as an organized desk.  However, the entire room is covered by a layer of
dust. Obviously, these quarters have not been used for quite some time.  The
only exit is to the North.

Forest Clearing^
  You are standing in a clearing in a forest. All around the clearing 
there are trees that stand as tall as giants, this must be a very old 
forest. To the north you see a large waterfall that seems to go up for 
miles and miles and you stare at it in awe. The clearing becomes smaller 
and turns into a very large path to the east.

The path that you are walking on is covered with pine needles and pine 
cones of various sizes and sorts. The path continues to the east and 
there is a clearing to the west.

Aside the River in the Forest^
  You are next to a river that you figure runs from the waterfall that 
you saw back in a clearing. The trees here are a little shorter than 
the other ones that you have seen. There is a bridge that goes over the 
river that leads up to some mountains to the north and to the east the 
forest continues.

the trees seems to sooth you a little bit and you look down the path and

Small Pond in Forest^
  There is a large clearing in the forest here with a small pond in the 
middle of it. The pond is a beautiful shade of blue and you can see 
little fish swimming around in it. To the north is a small shop and to 
the east is what looks to be the beginning of a swamp.

Head of Mountain Path^
  Looking ahead you notice that the mountains that this path goes through 
are pretty impressive. They seem to just continue onward and upward forever.
The path continues to the north and the forest is to the south.

Mountain Path^
  The mountain path is climbing quite quickly and you stop to catch your 
breath before deciding to go onward. Against a cliff face to the north 
there are a few vines that look to be a few inches thick which would give
plenty of support for a body to climb up them.

they don't look quite as supportive as the ones that you just climbed up 
with.

can but it's too late..the vine rips and you plummet hundreds of feet to 
the ground smashing your head against a large rock...

danger and evil monsters. You also know that the forest is a place full 
of mystery and many treasures lie within it.

Inside of the Dwarven Forest^
  The dwarven forest seems to be a lot darker than the other parts that 
you have been through so far. You can not hear the sounds of birds 
chirping here and you feel a little uneasy because of it.

allowing only a few rays on sunlight to strike against the ground 
revealing large bushes that climb the sides of the castle walls. The

   Blue cellophane covers the walls to give this shrine an underwater look.  
Plastic fish and a crab resembling Sebastian are glued to the fake water.  This 
room is really tacky.  The Femmenazi who decorated this probably threw 
Tupperware parties in a former life.

&+WShrine to Medusa&*^
   There appear to be lots of stone statues here.  They seems somehow familiar. 
 At the base of each statue you see odd runes that look like:

&+WShrine to She-Ra&*^
   A powerful golden sword is embedded in an anvil here.  A winged headdress 
sits at its base.  The Femmenazis like her because they know that she outshines 
He-Man anytime.  Besides... she's good-looking.

&+WShrine to Malefiscence&*^
   The smell of evil, ichorous incense fills this room.  In the smoky light you 
can just make out a spinning wheel in the corner.  Somehow you feel that you 
shouldn't go play with it, tho that feeling could stem from the fact that the 
Femmenazis would be very upset at you  for even considering doing any domestic 
work.  You do NOT want to upset a Femmenazi...

discuss hot topics such as curfews for men, visiting hours, leash laws, and 
whether or not men should be allowed into Ladies Nite at their favorite bar.

the monument stands a tall plastic palm tree.  Stuffed into its branches is an 
asp.

Calamity Jane was a great gunfighter in the American Old West.  Why she felt 
she had to disguise herself as a man no Femmenazi will ever understand.  But 
none the less... they liked her.

&+WShrine to Siren&*^
   Probably one of the favorite Femmenazi heroines of all time... the Siren.  
She would lull men to a rocky isle with her voice, where they would drown; 
their boats destroyed on the rocks.  She killed a good many men in her day... 
and caused a lot of ego-downers.

   You have entered a large maze whose walls are made of well-pruned bushes.  
The bushes are tall enough that you can't see over them and so thick that you 
can't see through them.  This maze is clearly an attempt to contain prisoners

There's a path which runs north into the forest and two smaller paths which
run from the front door and around the house east and west.

cutting through the landscape from the north and southwards.  On the other
side of the canyon you can see vast fields stretching several miles into the
land before ending where a big mountain range cuts out through the surface of
the earth.  This view certainly makes the white house look small and insign-
ificant, which at its western wall offers nothing but a small window.
There is a tiny little path going around the house to the north and south here.

at the south wall.
A narrow stair ascends into darkness, while a doorway leads south into
a living room.  A small window is set into the western wall.

furniture and a large oriental rug are badly ravaged.

from the waterfall above you.  The noise of the waterfall hitting the pool is
quite immense, but you still feel relaxed by being here.  A few salmon are
swimming around in the clear water snapping a fly now and then. A rainbow
spans the pool in the spray of the waterfall. 
The water flows southwards forming a river which through thousands of years
has dug out a big canyon cutting through the land.  To the west, across the
canyon, you can see large fields and further beyond, a mountain range.
A tough, but manageable climb will take you up into the mountain above, while
a track leads south into a vast forest.

darkness and what you sense is danger.  You may of course also retreat
back up into the livingroom.

illuminates the cavern with dim light.
The water flows slowly southwards into a huge reservoir in the deeper
parts of the cave.
An eastward path leads back to where you came from.

You have entered a rather large storeroom which is filled with racks
that seem to have been robbed of their contents.  Along the walls,
shelves have been suspended, most of them containing nothing but dust.
You may reenter the tunnel from where you came, to the west.

You stand on top of a long flight of stairs descending hundreds of feet
down into darkness.  The steps are nearly worn down of use by people and
other beings walking, running and crawling up and down here for dozens
of centuries.

growth of slippery moss and lichen covering both steps and walls.  You can

&+WBottom of the Stairs&*^
You are standing by the east wall of an enormous cavern.  This cavern
is in fact a huge reservoir of water, and stretching out before you to
the west is an artificial dam wall.
Up to the north is a steep stairway, and one step up from the ground
right east of you is a large and heavy steeldoor, which is corroded stuck in
an open position.  The east end of the dam wall is south.

&+WEast End of Dam&*^
You are standing on the eastern part of a dam wall.
The dam wall, being about 30 meters wide continues westwards to the other
end of the cavern. Through a door to the east there's a little office
obviously used by maintenance personnel in the times when there where
more traffic here than at present.  There's also a flight of steps leading
down on the south side of the dam wall.  It disappears into the deep and
dark dry area of the cavern which is kept dry by the dam wall.
To the north you can make out the beginning of a staircase leading up.

&+WHalfway Down the Stairs&*^
You are halfway down a flight of stairs which leads up into a high vaulted
cavern which is dimly lit.  Down below you, in the darkness, is a outlet 
of some power lines.

&+WThe Outlet&*^
You are down at the base of the dam wall which stretches up hundreds of feet 
above you.  Right above you, out of the wall, three thick power lines emerge
and they are stretched over a small, but very fast-flowing river out of sight
to the southwest.  A very fast-flowing river emerges out of the dam wall a 
couple of yards west of you and disappears out of sight into southern parts of
the cavern.  There is no way of following the river southwards or crossing it.
Sparks jump now and then from lots of tiny cords which hang down from the 
three power lines, thus enlightening the place in a strange blue and green light.
Th The place is surely in lack of maintenance, so you would better get
out of here.  It can be done by climbing a flight of stairs which is
cut out in the side of the wall.

&+WThe Dam&*^
Standing here on the middle of this huge damW all makes you feel small
compared to your surroundings.  Way down below you on the south side of
the dam wall you hear the sound of fast flowing water and to the north
the huge cavern stretches out for hundreds of yards.  The dam wall
continues to the east and west.

&+Wdam Office&*^
You are in the dam office, which according to piles of dust and dead
insects must have been unused for decades.  There is an old desk here,
worn down both with age and with rough use from the maintenance-
personnel which used this room as their base when doing work on the dam.

&+WSteep Passage&*^
You are in a steep and narrow tunnel leading up.  This tunnel has
certainly not been used by to many guests, because the steeps are still
rough hewn and not worn down like other stairs in the area.  It has
probably been used only by people who once upon a time took care of the dam.
Down to the west is a large and sturdy steeldoor leading back into the cavern.

&+WPassageway&*^
You are in a wide and high vaulted passageway which comes in from the
north and branches off into an eastward tunnel that is no less in
size. 
Carved into the rock of the two main tunnels are two big arrows; one
pointing to the north and the other to the east.  Under the first
arrow the word BANK is written and under the second one the words
MAIN GUE have been written.

&+WBlocked-off Passage&*^
You are standing in the wide and high vaulted passage.  Unfortunately the
passage has been block off by what to normal standards looks like a
major cave-in.  The cave-in consists of nothing but large and immovable
rocks.  From marks and scratches on the rocks you realize that there
have been other people here before you who have tried to make a
passage through the cave-in.  You might as well give up the thought of
getting beyond this major rockfall.  A wiser decision is to reenter
to the west and try the north or south passage.

&+WBy the Bank&*^
You are standing at the corner of a building which looks like a bank.
It could as well be something else, but the word BANK was the first
word that entered your mind when getting near th the place.
Let's say it is a bank.
The bank is actually not another cave, but it is built in a large cave,
and may therefore be called a building.
The main entrance to the bank is to the east, and north of here there
is a door which also leads into the bank.
A wide and high vaulted tunnel starts here and leads south.

&+WThe Main Entrance&*^
You stand in front of the main entrance of the bank which is dominated by
a huge and arched oakdoor set between mighty pillars carved out of
rock in one piece.  The door is barred with strong iron bars and it
will take you a lot of work to get through it.
It is possible to go east and west from the main entrance.

&+WBlocked passage&*^
The tunnel east of the bank is stopped abruptly by a boulder which fills the 
tunnel with rock from ground stone-dust size up to the size of rocks which 
will never be moved by humans alone.  Even a mouse won't be able to crawl 
through this boulder.  Thus, the only exit for you is to the west.

&+WSide Entrance&*^
This is the west side of the bank of Frobozz and it seems much more
promising than the main entrance.  That is due to a door of normal
size and construction which is situated right in front of you in a
corner of the building.  The bank is certainly in lack of windows, but
you have already figured out that the bank trusts the Great Under-
ground Empire's inhabitants because this side entrance will certainly
not be impossible to break down even for you.

&+WThe Bank of Frobozz&*^
You are in the main hall of the bank of Frobozz.  The roof is held up
by mighty stone pillars like those you saw outside the main door
which leads into this room.  The ceiling is made of dark wood, and
combined with the light colours which the walls are decorated with and
the fine gold inlay in the massive pillars the whole room resembles
something like a temple raised for a highheld god.
Right to the north is the tellers' room and that's where you may
withdraw spare money or let the bank take care of them.
In the south wall of this stunning room there is the main entrance to
the bank.  The door is barred with strong iron bars which makes the
bank look very safe.

&+WLuncheon Room&*^
You have just entered the bank-personnel's luncheon room.  The room is
abandoned just as if something terrible has happened.  They did not
even have time to clear the place from the waste and rubbish from their
meals.  The mess surely indicates that they didn't wait guests to pop in.
There is a door in the south wall and an entrance into the more important
parts of the bank.

You have entered the tellers' room.  This is where the transactions of
money once in the past happened.  There are about a dozen of tidy and
rather impressing desks here which were used by the tellers when
doing business with their clients.  The desks are now covered with
dust.  To the south, through a high and arched opening you can look
into an impressive hall.  It is probably the main hall of the bank of
Frobozz.  Through a similar, but smaller opening to the north you see
a large and representable office.  There is also a doorway to the east
and to the west a doorway leads back into the luncheon room.

&+WOutside the Vault&*^
You are in what must be the entrance to the vault of the bank because written
on top of the southern wall are the letters "V A U L T".  But you can't seem
to find the vault door.  Is it simply a walk-through-wall or is the vault door
fitted so nicely into the wall that you can't find it ?
The room is lit by some kind of light which comes through a thick-glassed 
window measuring 1 foot in square set into the northern wall.
The tellers' room lies to the west.

&+WChairmans Office&*^
It is clear from the size both the room and its contents that this must
be the chairman's office.  The room measuring about 10 times 8 yards
contains nothing of excess, but the stuff that has been placed here
is of extraordinary quality and must surely have costed many a tellers
wages.  Right in front of you completely dominating the room is a large
mahogany desk which is one of the bigger you have seen.  Right behind it
placed up to the wall is a cupboard which in quality and splendor must
have been made by Chippendale himself.  More discretely in one corner
an inviting sitting-group almost begs you to take a seat.
To the south an opening leads into the tellers' room.

&+WDark and Drafty Chamber&*^
You have entered a dark and drafty chamber.  The draft is not that
strong here, but that is because this chamber is much bigger than the
narrow tunnel you used to get here.
This chamber is nearly pitch dark, but a few sunbeams manage to get
through a crystal grating in the ceiling.  The grating is just
reachable but the size of it prevents you from climbing through it when opened.
Worth noticing are the extremely dark walls of this chamber.  It is as
if they are made of light-absorbing material.
There is an exit to the south and another exit into a pitch dark
chamber to the east.

   After hours of trudging through the snow you come upon a tiny inn.  A sign
above the door says "Warm Haven -- Abandon Cold, All Ye Who Enter."  The room
is crowded with burly adventurers, shy novices, and the bustling of serving
wenches and bar-maids trying to take everyone's orders.
   The main door is to the south, while a side-door heads west into the frozen
wastes.  A number of urchins are gathered around the crackling fire to hear
tales and songs from the Bard.
   To the north you can enter the small sleeping quarters of the inn.

are spears.  Breast-plates litter the benches.  A wolf lurks at the western
door, and an eagle hovers over it.  A deep and wild looking river, Thund,
roars beside Valgrind, the outer gate.  Five hundred and forty doors lead
off in different directions, but you suspect that eight hundred warriors
stand behind each one, so you opt not to open any of them.

the gods themselves to wed.  A simple podium in the center of this clearing
lends to the overall impression that this is a holy place.
   Stands have been hewn out of the mountain and intricately carved with an
animal motif.  Each of the 50 seats depicts a different creature, and all
appear calm and serene.

more than just kick & scream productions. A large window allows you to look

with Science Fiction books and souvenirs from far away places.

&+WThe Iris Gardens&*^
   Tall, ancient cypress, oak and pine trees standing in the black water of
what was once a swamp, now look down on more than a quarter of a century's
accumulation of some twenty-five varieties of Kaempferi Iris. Huge flowers,
six to ten inches in diameter, crown slender stems ranging from one to three
feet in height. The foliage is luxuriant and arching and remains green
throughout the year. Numbering by the thousands and with as many colors as the
rainbow, the Iris are indescribably beautiful.
   The black swamp waters reflect the shadows of black swans that glide
gracefully on the surface and complement the Iris by their live beauty. The
white water lilies plus exotic red, pink and yellow lilies are exquisite. The
abundance of flowers and wild life present a scene that cannot be duplicated by
camera or brush.

   You look around, and find yourself sitting on a cloud, soft as a

waiting for you to explore it.
   The wind blows softly in your ear, and you feel very relaxed. You
really feel like you could stay here forever...

&+WForest^
You find yourself in a small, sunny meadow, enclosed by an ancient oak
forest. Colourful birds sing in the trees, and the air is scented by myriads
of flowers, butterflies fluttering among them. To your delight, you realize
that some of the butterflies are actually tiny fairies, dancing and playing
in the sun. Others sit on the branches of the great trees, playing a variety
of musical instruments, adding a deeper enchantment to the birds' song. On one
of the sturdier branches hangs a swing, its ropes covered with flowering vines.
   The weather is warm, and the moss covered bowers provide welcome shade to
rest in for those weary of play. Here, the fairies have prepared a great feast,
and they welcome you to share it.

with some impressive weapons you dare not touch.  On his desk you see some
scrolls covered with Nordic runes, and an unfinished supper, indicating the
Iceman has only stepped out for a moment.  You notice several copies of "Teach
Yourself Swedish" in the bookcase, but one seems to be missing.  A portrait of
his beautiful wife, Lady Galadriel, adorns the otherwise bare walls.
   A single exit leads south.

glisten on the rocks and edelweiss grow in the most unlikely places, among
stones and unfinished ice sculptures.

giant Thrym and Mjolnir, of the ship Skidbladnir and Ragnarok, and of the One
Tree, Yggdrasil.  The hall is deserted now, and you wonder where everyone is
hiding.  There is some sort of door in the northern wall.

   A cobweb brushes across your face.  From the abundance of them here, it
would seem that this room does not see much use.  Though the dimness of the
light does not allow you to be sure, the groaning of the ceiling causes
you to move quietly, as you would rather not have the tons of mountain
above you fall in.
   Closer examination of the walls reveals ancient, intricate images of huge
glaciers and a figure you can only guess to be the god of the Ice People,
who they venerate here.

&+WStart of the Tour&*^
   The purpose of this game is to become a Wizard. You can achieve this
by gaining points. How to gain points will be explained later in this Tour.
The world in this game consists of a number of "rooms". Each room has a 
number of exits, which lead to other rooms. Possible directions are:
north, south, east, west, up and down. To display the exits valid in the
room you're in, type 'exits'. To go in the direction you want, just type
the name of the direction. E.g. if you want to go south, just type 'south'.
Now you can try any direction you want.

The exit Up^
   You choose the exit to the Up. You can now choose to go back and
try another exit or you can proceed with the tour by going south.
Oh, by the way: When you type 'autoexits' (only once) you will automatically
see all the exits valid in that room.

The Next Step^
   Now you found out how to move around, I will make it a little easier
on you. You move around by typing the complete direction you want. You
can abbreviate the direction though: When you want to go south, just
type 's', 'so', 'sou', 'sout' or 'south'. Most of the time you want to
use the shortest possible command (just 's'). This rule of abbreviation
is valid for ALL commands on the MUD. One thing you have to keep in mind,
is that a certain abbreviation might mean something different as you think
it means. Because of this, you might want to use the normal, long commands
for commands, other than the movement commands. At least until you're a
little more experienced...

Other players^
   You are not the only player on this MUD. Most of the times, there are
many other players, just like you trying to become a Wizard (the ultimate
purpose of this game). You can see who's playing by typing 'who' or 'users'.
 will show you a list of players. It will also show how far they are on
their journey to become a Wizard (their level). The more points you gather,
the higher your level will be.

Communication^
   Sometimes you want to tell another player something, e.g. if you want
him/her to help you. There are several ways you can do this:
   - You can type 'say <msg>' where <msg> is the message you want to say.
     Anything you SAY, will only be heard in the room you're in.
   - You can type 'tell <player> <msg>' where player is the player you
     want to tell something. Only the player you specify will hear you
     message, wherever he is.
   - You can type 'chat <msg>'. This will be heard by everybody in the MUD
     except the ones that have turned off this feature (by typing 'nochat').
   - You can also type 'shout <msg>'. This does exactly the same as CHAT,
     but it is considered a bad habbit if you do this too often. Don't
     SHOUT unless you think it's absolutely necassary.

&+WObjects&*^
   Everywhere in the mud there are objects. They all have a different use.
Some objects are just for decoration, some are weapons, some are food, etc.
Where there is an object in a room there will be some clue for you to
know that there is an object and how that object is called. Very often
this clue is something like: 'A lunch is lying here' or something like that.
In this room there is a knife, just as the bottom-line of this description
says. You can get an object by typing 'get <object name>'
or 'take <object name>'. To get all the objects in the room (which you CAN
get, not all objects are 'getable') you can type 'get all' or 'take all'.
   You can also examine objects by typing 'examine <object>'.
Now try to examine and take the knife.

Gathering Points^
   There are two ways to gather the points you need to become a Wizard.
The first is to kill so called 'mobiles'. Mobiles are persons, monsters,
dwarfs, giants etc. that walk around in the MUD. Everything you need to 
know about combat will be explained later.
The second way the gather points is to drop objects in a 'pit'. Each
object has a value. This value can be viewed by typing 'value all'.
When you drop an object in a pit, you get the value of the object added to
your score. There are two pitholes in the MUD. One is in the Village Church
and the otherone is in the Temple of Paradise. Each time you enter
the game, you start in one of these rooms.

Combat^
   The fastest way to gain points is to kill mobiles. When you hit a 
mobile you get points, but when a mobile hits you, you loose strength.
When your strength reaches 0 you die and become a ghost (type 
'info ghosts' to get more info on that). At that time you loose 
approx. half your score! If you're not fighting, you can regain 
your strength by typing 'sit'. This will not go very fast, so take your
time. When you are fully healed you will receive a message.
   If you're fighting a mobile, and it looks like you're gonna loose,
you can type 'flee <dir>', where <dir> is a valid direction in the room
where you are at the moment of fleeing. You will then abort the fight
and loose a small percentage of your score (3%). That's always better
than dying (and loose half your score). In this room there's one mobile
called The Monster. Maybe you can examine him for a start...

How to get help^
   When you need help, there are a number of ways to get it.
First, you can ask a Wizard, ArchWizard, High-Demigod, God or 
Master (if one is available). They are here to help you.
If none is available at the moment you need help, you can ask another
player on the MUD. Most people will help you if they can, although some
might not want to be disturbed.
You can also type 'help' or 'info'. Both will give you a listing of 
main subjects available. Type 'help <subject>' or 'info <subject>' to
get help on that subject.

The End of the Tour^
    This is the end of the tour. We wish you good luck in the game.
You should read the 'info policy' to know what you shouldn't do
(e.g. killing other players).
Again, if you need any help, just ask for it.
To get out of the tour, you must drop all your stuff. This will sacrifice
it to the gods, for a small reward.

for a while.  The barn continues to the south, to the east and west are small
stalls, and there is a ladder leading up to the hayloft against the west wall.

     The field here is still fallow, and you notice small animal footprints in
the soft ground beneath your feet.  The soil in this field looks very fertile
and you wonder why the farmer hasn't planted here is so long.  The field here
extends to the south and east.

wallpaper, and there are all kinds of pots and pans hanging from a rack above a

The Gates to Fairyland^

into a loose, but solid, sense of twisting realities.  Before you, above you,
below you, or somewhere like that you see the gates to a strange, mystical land.

Fairy Wood^
     Lost.... You find yourself stumbling through a large, misty wood that seems
to extend in all directions to infinity.  The trees seem to be moving around you
opening paths through the thickest brush and closing before allowing you to go
down the clearest path.  The sky above you is fairly visible through the tree
tops, but as you look up all you see are incredible vortices of swirling color.

The Sun^
     You find yourself suddenly walking on the surface of the sun.  You are
surrounded by a vast expanse of incredibly bright surface upon which through
much squinting and shading you can vaguely make out the shapes of strange
creatures floating around you in all directions.  As you look down at your feet,
you notice that they are on fire, but it seems ok because you can't feel any
pain right now.

Around the Campfire^
     As you come to your senses for another burst of something that looks as if
it could vaguely approach reality, you find yourself sitting by a small campfire
in the middle of nowhere discussing the finer qualities of crossbreeding
earthworms with racehorses with several people you have never seen before in
your life.  This, however, doesn't strike you as very inconvenient or unusual
because your having a good time anyway.

lead out of here.

Mugwump Central^
     You stand in the center of a large rectangular room with exits in all
directions.  As you look around this place you see several rows of disgusting,
lizard-like creatures that could only have come out of a horrible nightmare.
All of them are strung upside down from the ceiling and most have a person or
two kneeling on the floor beneath them sucking thick fluids from erect, hollow
tubes growing from the heads of the creatures.  As you look at the people here,
you notice that they seem to be enjoying themselves, but you also get the
feeling that many of them have been here for years.

around your feet and ankles so that whenever you take a step it creates swirls
and eddies in surface of the mist.

anyway.  Off in the distances all around you you can make out millions of stars,
but you can't seem to focus on any of them long enough to get your bearings
because every time you move your head your field of vision is filled with
millions of brightly colored trails coming from each star.

lost and not being able to figure out where you were.

colors spinning everywhere off into nowhere....

music might be coming from.

Up the Beanstalk^
     You are about half way up this huge beanstalk.  Small vines and branches
grow out everywhere making it an easy climb to get the rest of the way up, or
you can go back down to the field below you.  As you look around from here you
see a small village off to the south and the vast expanse of the sea to the
east.  To both the north and the west you see a magnificent chain of mountains
running in the distance.

often. luckily there are plenty of branches you can stop and rest on.  You can
continue up the beanstalk or go back down from here.

tops of the clouds are solid!  As you look around you notice that the sun is
really bright this far up and you realize that the weather up here must always
be great without any clouds above you to block out the sun.  There is a path
that leads off to the north over the cloudy terrain and you can climb back down
the beanstalk if you want to.

at you immediately though is that under it there isn't a moat, as a matter of
fact, there isn't anything.  Looking down all you see are mountain tops.  Better
not fall off of this one.

The Courtyard^
     This is a gigantic courtyard.  Not only is the place almost a mile across,
but everything is HUGE!  The path you are standing on is paved with cobblestones
almost the size of things that you seem to remember being called Cadillacs, and
the flowers that fringe the edges are as large as small trees.  From the north
you hear a loud roar that sounds like a waterfall and to the south you see what
must be the garden, but it looks like a rain forest to you.  The drawbridge is
back to the west and the door to this gigantic castle is to the east.

     You are standing next to a huge fountain.  The noise from the water is
nearly deafening there is so much of it.  The mist that comes off from the
splashing water feels almost like rain, even though, here above the clouds, the
sun is always out.  If you stand on your tippie-toes you can just reach the top
edge of the side to climb up if you want to.

The Garden^
     You are at the end of a what must be a small path for the proprietor of
this garden.  The path is surrounded on all sides by fencing.  To the south,
however, it looks like one of the links has been bent just enough for you to
squeeze through.

In the Monkeygrass^
     You have entered a small clearing in the midst of several large clumps of
monkey grass that block all exits into the garden.  There is, however, a gaping
hole in the ground here that you can venture down if you want to.

The Garden^
     You have reached the end of the path. As you look around, though, you can't
help but marvel at the enormity of the plants here.  What must only be small
shrubs here look like the mightiest redwoods you have ever encountered.  You can
only imagine the size of the beings that must care for this place.

In the Hole^
     You are scrambling down the side of a huge tunnel that goes straight down
for about fifty yards and then continues off into darkness.  Fortunately, the
walls are rough enough to allow you to climb back out if you need to.

Bottom of the Hole^
     You are standing in a dirt tunnel that looks as if it was dug rather
recently.  The tunnel is large enough for you to stand easily upright and still
have plenty of room to spare.  The tunnel runs east and west into darkness.

In the Tunnel^
     The tunnel turns to south up ahead and continues into darkness.  As you
look at the floor you see some very large footprints that seem to indicate that
this is a fairly well traveled route, although by looking at the prints you
can't really tell what it is that travels here.

Damp Intersection^
     The tunnel is intersected here by another tunnel that is coming up from the
west.  The dirt is fairly wet here and there are small drop of water dripping
slowly from the ceiling in some places.  Someone must be watering the garden
above you.

that you are still up among the clouds.

     You have reached the lowest possible point of the tunnel.  Directly to the
south you see an opening that is letting in small tufts of cloud.  You see many
deep claw markings around the edge of the drop off and you wonder what could
possibly have made them.  There is a chamber to the east, or you can go back up
the tunnel to the north.

to the north and south.  The smell seems to be coming from the south.

     As you enter this room, you step on a pile of intestines and fall to the
floor where you are covered with blood and guts.  After a few tries you manage
to scramble to your feet and maintain your balance.  The stench of rotten flesh
in here is almost overwhelming, and as you examine the many entrails and bones
lying around the room you notice that they are exclusively human.

it gets home.

The Library^
     This is a fairly small library for being in a place of this size.  There
could scarcely be many more than a hundred volumes in here, making you think
that this would definitely not be a good place to start work on a research
paper.  The books that there are, however, are so big that you would have to
stand on them to read them.

not be so sure about thunder.

Half Way Down^
     You have stopped to rest half way down the giant staircase.  It's easier
going while you are trying to go down them than it will be trying to get back
up, but if you're on your way back up you know that by now.

Bottom of the Stairs^
     You are at the bottom of the stairs.  Looking up to the east, you see the
huge staircase that you're going to have to struggle back up, and from the west
you hear many anguished screams and groans coming from the dungeon of this
castle.

Dungeon Corridor^
     This is a large, dim, smoky corridor that is lit by sparsely separated
torches that are giving of sputtery light and lots of smoke.  So much smoke has
come from these torches that all of the walls and ceilings have been stained
black with soot from them.  The corridor leads west back to the stairs or east
through a door deeper into the dungeon.  There are also rooms to the north and
south.

     As you enter the torture chamber, you are almost overwhelmed by the sheer
size of the equipment here.  Luckily for you, though, none of it is small enough
for you to fit on it.  This brings you little relief, though, when you think
that all these people have to do is step on you.

     You are in the deepest inner reaches of this cow pasture.  The thick Grass
grows almost up to your waist, and, to your surprise, there aren't even any
flies in here!  The grass is soft and gentle and seems to be caressing you as
you walk through this mystical place.  As you look down at your feet you make
out millions of tiny pinpoints sparkling in myriads of different colors.  As you
look closer you realize that this is just the light sparkling off of the rich
soil on the ground.

spaced evenly along both walls providing plenty of light to see by. Much
further to the south the torches end, and it appears that someone is standing
there by a door. The floor here is dirt, but oddly enough your footsteps sound
hollow.

many torches lining the passageway. A heavy wooden door, banded with iron,
is set in the west wall.

royal family. Oddly enough, however, it is completely blank.
The east wall is occupied by a huge fireplace in front of which sits the
royal Lazy-boy, a chair fit for a king.

Gold seems to guild everything here. Even the ceiling is inlaid with gold
patterns surrounding the splendid royal seal. The bed, perhaps the largest you
have ever seen, is covered with sheets of luxurious gold silk. You get the
impression that this king was a little obsessed with his gold.

coated with soot that rubs off on you and makes you sneeze. You can't climb
any higher than this because of a small ledge constricting the chimney.

&+WLong Cold Passageway&*^
   This passageway is filled with cold air that goes right through your clothes
and makes you shiver uncomfortably. The heavy frost that has collected on the
walls reminds you of an icebox that hasn't been cleaned out in years.
To the north you can just make out the light of the many torches that line the
walls there, and to the south there is a small light at the end of the tunnel.

The footing here is treacherous. Small avalanches of scree are set off by your
footsteps as you scramble along the fell. Any descent would be impossible.
The only other way out is up to the top of the fell which is covered in snow.

   This is the top of a large glacier that extends down the steep mountainside.
The fresh snow here looks good for skiing. Of course you'd best be careful or
you might set of an avalanche. To the south you can barely make out the bottom
of the glacier through the glare from the snow. West of here lies the fells.

Entrance to the Professor's House^
   You have entered a charming and large old house. The house is not in the
best of upkeep, but it is charming just the same. As you enter, you can hear
the floors creak under your feet. You peer around the corners into the other
rooms on this floor, and a sense of wonder overcomes you. This house seems
full of mystery and enchantment, of a type you can not explain. For some
reason you feel an uncontrollable urge to explore.

The Old Staircase^
   You are standing on an old staircase that reaches up to the second floor.
Each step creaks and gives a little under your weight, but the stairs seem
very solid. Straight ahead of you at the top of the stairs, you can look into
a room that is painted a curious green colour. You can see light coming from
the hall that seems to indicate open doors of some sort, although you are not
yet far enough up the stairs to see the source.

   You find yourself in the living room of this old house. The wallpaper is
peeling and the floors are in disrepair, but there is something about this
place that you like. The more you look around, the more you feel an urge
to explore.

The Dining Room^
   The only furniture in this simple dining room are a small table and a
drysink. There is a small throw rug under the table to keep it from further
damaging the floor. Covering the drysink are all sorts of papers that look
like they are probably important to the Professor. You do not dare to touch
them.

The Kitchen^
   Wandering into the kitchen, it is the appliances that first catch your eye.
They are old-fashioned and look like they have been in use for many more years
than you have been alive. They are all functional, however. The air in the
kitchen is warm and smells of chocolate. You look around hungrily for whatever
was made.

The Back Stairs^
   You find yourself climbing the back stairs of the house. These stairs
obviously aren't used very often, as there is no light here. The stairs
themselves are free of dust and objects, but you still get the idea that
they aren't used much. The stairs are very loud under your feet. At first
the darkness is such that you can't see well, but your eyes adjust and the
further up you go, the more light that is provided by the room above.

The Library^
   You are now standing in the library of this large house. There is an
impressive number of books here, all musty and covered with dust from age.
The books are well-worn and are obviously very treasured by the owner. The
Professor merely seems to have very poor house-cleaning skills and he
wouldn't dream of letting the maids near his library. This room seems to
be where the Professor spends most of his time.

The Library^
You have moved to the eastern end of the library. At this end is an easy 
chair with a small table on one side, upon which is sitting a lamp. The
lampshade and table are dusty and a book is resting on the table. In the
wall is a fireplace, which makes a great decoration. However it seems like
it hasn't been used in years.

The Back Porch^
   Standing on the back porch, you take in the view in the back of the house.
Behind the house is a large woods, which is alive with summer. The leaves on
the trees are big and green. There is a small stream running somewhere
nearby. The large open lawn looks healthy and green. You look into the woods
and ponder all of the interesting adventures that could probably be had out
there.

To the north and west are bedrooms, while to the south is a hallway that is
lined with open doors.

The Bed Room^
   Despite the faded wallpaper and creaky floorboards, this bedroom is rather
pleasant. At one end of the room are four twin sized beds. At the other end
are four wooden dressers with mirrors over them. There are also two large
closets at that end of the room. The room seems tidy but occupied.

The Balcony^
   The balcony sits high above the ground. From the angle of the view of the
woods, it seems to you that this balcony is directly over the porch on the
lower floor. The view is the same, except for the angle. You look off into
the woods behind and can almost make out a flowing stream. If you listen
carefully you can hear the calls of summer life.

The Green Room^
   This is a long room that is painted green. As curious as it looked from
the hallway, you find the room quite boring. The ONLY thing that is here of
any interest whatsoever is a harp. The rest of the room is void of furniture
...void of anything.

   You are in the only room on the face of the earth that you think can
possibly be more boring than the Green Room. At least that room had a harp...
All that you can see here is a wardrobe. Just a boring old wardrobe....
Or is it?

The Picture Room^
   You have entered a long room with pictures all over the walls. This room
seems to be the only place in the house with any sort of decoration. You
secretly think that the Professor should have spread the pictures out over
the entire house instead of cramming them all into this one room, but hey,
who died and made you the interior decorator?

   You have entered yet another spare bedroom. The room has painted white
walls and is the first well-decorated room you have been into in this house.
There is a queen-sized bed covered with a white spread. There is a small
table next to the bed with a vase of flowers on it. The room looks almost as
though the Professor expects it to be needed at any moment.

   You step into the wardrobe, very careful to leave the door open behind you.
Your mother always warned you that it was rather silly to shut yourself up in
a wardrobe... unfortunately you never listened to a word she said.

   You vaguely sense that this is the back of the wardrobe. You would expect
to feel the back wall of the wardrobe at any time, but you keep searching and
find nothing. After searching and feeling your way through the coats that
surround you, your hands reach out and feel something rough and cold. It
turns out your hands are not on a coat as expected, but a tree!

Between Worlds^
   You are standing in what appears to be a wintery land. Remembering that it
was summer back at the house, you are at first alarmed by the climate change.
As you look around at the woods around you, however, your sense of adventure
overtakes your fears, and you decide to head on into the woods. Now you must
only choose between the path to the east and the path to the north.

The Forest Path^
   The path leads to the north and south. It appears to split to the south-
west, but you can't be sure peering thru the thick brush. There are more
signs of wildlife here than in other parts of the forest.

   You are standing at a turn in the path. You can proceed either to the
north where the woods appear denser, or to the west where you can tell
there is a split in the path.

section of the path.

off a ways, but can't be certain.

The Forest Path^
   The woods have suddenly grown much colder, and you must trudge through
deep snow. The path is getting a bit more narrow here than you'd like, but
it is passable. You look to the southeast and think you see a small dead
tree with no branches in the middle of a clearing. However, from here, 
something about that tree looks very odd.

trail. What once looked like a dead tree is now obvious to you as a lamp
post. The lamp is not lit, although it looks like it has been recently.

shelter before it gets much darker.

there doesn't seem to be any other cover around.

Whale Rock^
   You find yourself at an odd looking rock. To your surprise, behind the
rock is a hidden cave mouth. It looks as if it was was once inhabited
although now it is pretty well torn apart and looks deserted. Perhaps that
would make a good home for the night.

Inside the Cave^
   You are inside the cave now where the air is nice and warm. Your only
problem is that it is dark and you cannot see very well. You find a corner
and curl up tight for the night. In the morning when there is enough light
for you to see by, you take a look around the cave. It was most definitely
occupied recently, but everything the occupant owned has been dashed apart
and broken. It looks as if someone has searched the place for something, and
destroyed everything in his path.

Winter Path^
   The path you are walking on seems to go on for miles into the wintery
wonderland. All around you, everything is white. Off in the distance
you hear what sounds like the jingling of bells. To the north are huge
mountains, while a frozen trail leads to the south.

The Path^
   You are at the base of some rather large foothills. The ground you are
on is curiously flat, until you realize by looking at a mound of sticks
nearby that you are walking on a frozen river. To the west you can see
where this river meets another one. The smooth frozen path leads up to
the northeast. You can follow a path beside it, or head north across the
second river and north to the unknown. You can also trudge to the south.

them. To the north you can see a downhill slope and then a flat area, which
looks very odd. To the south is a long trail down the mountains which leads
back into the woods.

To the north the path flattens a bit an continues downhill. Before you is 
a gigantic stone known to those of Narnia as the Stone Table.

The Underground Fortress^
   There is an entrance to an underground fortress under the western side
of the Stone Table. You hear evil cackling and other distressful noises
coming from inside that make you sure you don't want to go down. You hear
the voices of incubuses, wraiths, horrors, efreets, orknies, cruels, hags,
spectres, wooses, ettins, werewolves, boggles, minotaurs, ghouls, and other 
spirits coming from below and are gripped with fear.

Ahead of you, on the opposite bank, is an enormous golden castle of breath
taking beauty.

overcome by its beauty.

which will make steering to the other side difficult.

   You are in a rectangular courtyard, surrounded on three sides by the
imposing residence of the Snow Queen. You feel as though you are not alone,
as there are many stone statues all around you. They seem amazingly life-
like, except for the snow that is resting on top of all of them. In this
area there are a lot of statues of Dwarves.

   You have entered the Courtyard of the Castle of the Snow Queen. All
around you are statues of creatures that seem incredibly life-like. Dead
in front of you is a huge lion. He looks so life-like that at first you
are afraid. Suddenly you realize that snow has settled on top of him and
you realize that this could never be a real lion.

range. Those mountains form a wall to the north that runs all the way

   You finally make your way back onto solid land, and find yourself at the
feet of the largest, most beautiful castle you have ever seen or heard of.
The entire building seems to be made of gold and it shines like a beacon in
the strong sunlight. You have traveled far, and a few moments of rest in this
awesome place would do you some good. You trudge toward the entrance hall.

to really look at all of the splendour that is around you. To the north is
a stately marble staircase which leads to a well-lit glowing room at the top.

The Throne Room^

a few hundred feet tall and the room seems so wide that it would take a 
couple of minutes to cross it. There are four thrones here, all apparently
occupied.

that you expected to see, ahead of you is a huge black space.

hanging from the highest tower. It is one of the remains of the imperial
times. Nowadays it is used for special occasions, like weddings, counsil
meetings and the likes.

Thin Trail^
    Origionally created by animals, this trail has been widened by human
passage, although it looks as if it has not been traveled lately. The forest
has grown close to the edge of the trail, and thick branches reach overhead
that catch the snow. The thin trail continues to the east and to the south, the
snow much thinner there, and to the west there is an icy trail.

Dead End^
    The trail here is overrun with heavy brambles and thorns that compleatly
block your passage through. Beyond the brambles the forest continues, but
there does not seem to be any trails. The only way out is to follow the
thin trail back to the west.

Heavy Woods^
    The smell of pine is overwhelming. The floor of the forest is thick with
pine needles that rustle with each step you take. The sun shines through the
trees creates shifting shadows. The forest continues to the east and south,
but is much too thick in other directions to travel.

Thick Woods^
    The woods are thick and confusing. The smell of pine clogs your senses,
adding to the effect. The woods continue to the west and south. To the east
is a sandy clearing. Heavy brambles make passage to the north impossible,
which is unfortunate because there appears to be something in the distance
between the trees.

Sandy Clearing^
    The floor of the clearing is covered with pure white sand. The edges are
well defined, the sand not mixing with the dirt of the forest. The clearing
is filled with a sense of magic, but there is nothing noticable. In the
center of the clearing is a firepit, but the edges of the pit have no soot.
Thick brambles line the north and south of the pit, but the forest on the
east and west the forest looks thinner.

Thin Trail^
    The trail is thin and unkempt, the forest struggling to reclaim it. To
the east and west the trail thins out into forest, but to the north and south
the trail continues. The east trail is hreavily overgrown with brambles and
thorns. You can only see the sky in patches, the forest canopy has grown
thick over the trail.

Brambles^
    The thick brambles catch at you clothes as you walk. The trail ahead is

    covered with them, but you perservere.

    Hidden by the growth, the trail unexpectedly drops away under you. You

    trip and fall into the brambles, unable to stop your rolling. The trail

    becomes steeper, and the last sight you see is an endless sea of brambles

    and thorns.

    The thick forest surrounds you, overwhelming your senses. The forest
streches to the north, south, and east. The forest to the west is thick
and overgrown with brambles as far as you can see. There appears to be
trails, but after following them for a short time they fade away, leaving
you more lost then when you began.

Thick Forest^
    The forest turns you around, leading you along on false trails. You wish
you had a compassm but with these woods it might not do much good. The forest
leads to the north, south, and east. As is much of the forest, the western
way is blocked by thick and heavy forests.

Dirt Trail^
    Although the trail still has a lingering abandoned feel, it appears to
be used occaisionally. The trail winds through the deep woods to the east
and north. The canopy of the forest reaches overhead, blocking out much of
the sunlight, but the forest still has a warm feel.

    The town entrance is on a slight rise, giving you a good view of the
town before you. It is dotted by several temples, and has only a few
merchants. Thick woods lead away to the west, and what appears to be the
main street of the town continues to the east.

    The woods streches off into the distance, filling the area from horizon
to horizon. You struggle not to lose your direction, but it is impossible
to tell if you are still facing the way you began. The forest is full of
sharp thorns to the south, but to the north, and west it continues
uninteruptes. To the east there is a thin path covered in snow.

Snowy Path^
    The path is drifted with snow and there is a sharp chill in the air. A
gust of wind brings more snow down on you from the mountain peak that
covers the south-eastern horizon. The path continues to the south, and
fades away into the forest to the west.

    This clearing throbs with magic, the very trees almost glow with the
force of it.  A heavy wind whips through the trees as you enter, as if the
force that guards this clearing is displeased with your presence. It would
probably be a good idea to leave and not anger it further.

Snowy Trail^
    The trail is covered with snow that buried the rocks, making travel very
difficult. The trail slopes upwards steeply, obviously leading up the side
of the snow covered mountain that covers the south-eastern horizon. Far above
you there appears to be some sort of structure, but from here it is
impossible to tell. The trail slopes down to the east and up to the south.

Mountain Trail^
    The trail here slopes upwards, leading towards the top of the mountain,
although the end of the trail is obscured by the drifting snow. Forest covers
the horizon to the north, the green leaves a sharp contrast to the snowy
peaks above you. The trail continues flat towards the forest, or you can
follow it up the side of the mountain.

Huge Rock^
    You stand atop a huge snow-covered rock. The rock itself is over thirty
paces long, and it slants upwards to the east. The snow makes it difficult
to keep from slipping on the slick surface of the stone. The path drops away
to the north, and thick green forest streches below you.

    The ledge is covered with snow, and with each step you risk plunging into
the deep gorge below you. The stone at your back is rough and cold, and the
ledge is only a few paces wide. To the west a huge flat stone slants down
towards a path, and the ledge continues to the east.

    The ledge here narrows out further, but thankfully the cliff at your back
is lower and you can clamber into a small snowy field to the south. The snow
is blinding, and you cannot see the bottom of the gorge or the end of the
field. The ledge continues to the west, but to the east it becomes even
narrower.

    The ice is slick, and on your next step you slip.

    As you fall, you manage a desperate grab at the ledge, and by some

    miracle manage to grasp it.

    You dangle from the ledge, unable to scramble back up, for hours, shouting

    for help. No one is here to hear you.

    Finially your strength gives out, and you plunge hundreds of paces into

    the deep gorge below you.

south the trail passes beneath a huge stone arch.

    The clouds swirl around you, and the snow whips with stinging force into
your face. The dampness of the clouds soaks into your clothes, only to be

Temple Chamber^
    You stand just inside the temple. To the north the huge stone dragons
return to their positions guarding the entrance. To the east and west
smooth stone corridors turn corners to the south with mathematical
precision.

Stone Corner^
    The stone tiles join each other is complex patters that strech the entire
hallway. The hall turns the corner to the south with a perfect right angle,
and with further inspection you see that the hall itself is perfectly
straight.

Stone Hall^
    The patterns of the tiles draw you into them, and it takes a great
concious effort to pull your gaze away. The deep thrumming of magical
forces is even stronger now, but you still cannot find its source.
The hall turns corners to the north and south.

Elemental Chamber^
    The center of the chamber is dominated by a crystalline fountain that
is carved with intricate runes. The air is sweet, and it is ahrd to remember
that you are in a closed chamber. The fountain itself hums with immense
magical power.

Tiled Hallway^
    The tiles beneath your feet appear to shift as you walk, but when you
look closer they seem perfectly normal. The walls are windowless and made
of perfectly smooth polished stone. The hallway turns a corner to both the
north and south.

Stone Hallway^
    The stone in the hall flows and drips as you walk, but is not hot. The
floor beneath you rises and falls as if it were an ocean, and the walls shift
in liquid, flowing patterns. The noise is much stronger here, and an
ethereal light spills out of the northern chamber. The hall turns a corner
to the east.

Ice Hall^
    The hallway here is dripping with slowly flowing icicles and the floor is
slick with ice. No matter how much you try, you cannot focus on the walls, as
if they are actually further away then they appear. To the north the hall
becomes more normal, and to the south it appears that fire and ice meet
each other in a flowing artwork.

the heat, and you cannot survive much longer. To the north the hall becomes

artwork.

Fire and Ice^
    Amazingly, in this room fire and ice flow together, covering the walls
and creating a living, moving sculpture in the center of the chamber. You
gaze at it breifly, but when you look away it is several hours later. Time
means nothing in this room. To the north there is a smooth stone hallway,
and to the south there is a terrific wind, and you see what appears to be
a contained tornado.

Entrance Hall^
    As you step into the entrance hall, the stone dragons bellow in anger

    and chase after you. You run ahead of them, terror in your heart. One

    spreads its stone wings and flies ahead of you. You are trapped between

    the two of them. The last sight you see is them approaching you.

Sacred Clearing^
    The floor of the clearing is lined with pure white sand, and the
air throbs with immense stored magical energy. Time seems to pass in a
blur: Flowers sprout beneath your feet and die off again in seconds.
You feel a strange sensation on your legs and when you look down there
is a large ivy twining itself around your calfs. Paths lead off in all
directions. To the south, east, and west thin trails lead through lush
green forest, and to the north lies a huge forest of living crystal.

Crystal Trail^
    Huge crystaline trees overhang the trail and delicate crystal flowers
grow on the edge. You are afraid to touch any of them for fear that they
will shatter. Heavy wind blows through the tops of the trees, and to the
east there is an ominous groaning and cracking noise.

Crystal Trees^
    As you pass beneath the magestic crystal trees, a gust of wind blows

    through the top branches. There is a tremendous crack, and as you gaze

    up in horror a huge crystal branch crashes through the thinner boughs.

    You run as fast as possible, and throw yourself to the ground. The

    huge branch misses you, but when it strikes the ground it shatters

    into thousands of needle sharp shards. Almost is slow motion, several

    pieces fly at you, and the last thing you see is the sunlight glinting

    through them in beautiful rainbow patterns.

shards. The only way out is to return to the narrow path to the east.

Crystal Path^
    A small path leads through the heart of this forest of living crystal.
A light breeze whistles through the boughs overhead, and as the branches
rub together a beautiful melody floats through the air. The path continues
to the north and south, but it appears to dead end to the west.

refracted through the crystal boughs into a shimmering rainbow of color.
The crystal forest coninues to the west and north, but the northern forest
if much too thick to try to forge through. To the south the natural green
forest continues.

Green Forest^
    Healthy green forest streches as far as the eye can see. Far to the north
you hear a faint musical song. The forest to the west is filled with brambles
and there is no way to get through. A thin trail that must have been made by
animals leads to the south, and the forest continues unabated to the north.

only way you can tell directions is that there is a huge clearing filled
with immense magical energy to the north. The forest continues to the east,
but all other directions are blocked by brambles and thorns.

discharges into the sky in huge reverse lightning bolts.

stands open to the weather, the magic that allowed air to pass through but

north.

north wall is painted with a figure surrounded with lightning bolts, the
west wall is painted with a figure made completly of water stands up from
the sea, and on the east wall there is a figure that is made of living
vines, rocks, and other matter standing high above a forest. The south wall
is open to the air, and leads to the main street of the town.

there is nothing but beautifully manicured gardens.

god. In between the statues are immense guardion dragon statues, their
immense size almost rivaling that of the statues. Clearly among these people
dragons are held almost at the level of the elemental gods.

garden.

Northern Edge of Desert^
   The sun has reached its zenith as you arrive at the edge of a desert.  
Your feet start to feel heavy as you think this is your last chance to 
check your water bottle.  To the south you can see the rocky lands continuing
far out of your sight.  To the north the desert turns into thick thorny
bushes.

Wild Ox Crossing^
   Through the burning heat and rocky desert you stomp and stop for a moment
to have a look around.  The sand reflects the heat, making you wish it was 
night.  You are desperately trying to distinguish reality from mirage.  You
think you see paths leading in every direction.  To the south you can narrowly
make out a red hill breaking the horizon.

Shadow of the Cactus^
   You take a deep breath of relief as you find a nice seat in the shadow of
a tall thorny cactus.  You kick off your shoes and let the heat dry your
sweating toes.  Weak winds from the east blow gently through your hair and
the sweat on your shirt slowly evaporates, cooling down your back.  You
glance at the eastern skyline broken by odd structures in the distance.
Paths lead east and west.

Rocky Path^
   You can hardly make out a stony path winding between big rocks to the
east.  The path widens as you wander further east and you can make out
an old town far away at the edge of your sight.  Back to the west a vast
desert lies in the burning heat of the sun.

Desert Rose^
   A shower of rain has suddenly turned the earlier so dry and barren desert
into a sea of small but colorful flowers.  The rain cloud is slowly moving 
west and the sun casts its first rays upon this scented little paradise. 
You sit down on the ground, enjoying the peace and silence surrounding you.

&+WThe Forest Trail&*^
	You have wandered into a forest filled with very large and majestic 
trees of every type imaginable.  The quietness of the forest amazes you as your 
feet crunch quietly on the fallen pine needles.  The path that you are on leads 
to the west.

&+WForest Trail&*^
	Walking a little bit deeper into the forest you notice how tranquil 
everything is.  You start to feel a little strange, however, and you get light 
butterflies in your stomach as you get the feeling that you might be intruding. 
 To the north you notice a small hut, and to the west the forest continues.  
The section of forest to the west seems to be made up almost entirely of very 
large oak trees.

	You have entered a small hut.  The structure is falling down and is 
badly in need of maintenance.  There are holes in the wood that make up that 
walls, which allow for some light to get through.  On the floor you notice a 
small green object that seems to be wilting away.  You wonder what it is and 
how it got there.

	If the hut you are standing in was in better repair, this would be a 
very dark and foreboding room.  The shape of the walls, however, allows you to 
look around and see that this is a simple storage area which the owner of this 
hut must have once used to keep his gardening tools.

	You have reached the cluster of oaks, but as you stand at the edge of 
it, you notice that it is not a cluster, but a ring of trees!  In the center of 
the ring is the largest oak tree you have ever seen.  You stare up at it with a 
feeling of utter awe.  You suddenly feel very small and insignificant.

to be one of the youngest in the cluster, even though they all seem to be about 
the same age.  This tree is just a little smaller and the bark is just a bit 
smoother than many of the others.

other trees that comprise this marvelous ring.

&+WWestern Oak&*^

This particular tree captures your attention because it seems almost as 
grandiose as the center tree, although you almost get a feeling that the center 
tree would never allow for such competition.

appear 'ordinary,' this one would, except for one small detail.  There would 
appear to be a small hole between the roots about the size of your hand... but 
you don't really think there could be anything down there... or do you?

tree is absolutely breath-taking!  You look at the other trees circling around 
it and wonder how such a freak of nature occurred.  You look up at the massive 
branches and discover you can easily climb up the tree.

	You are sitting safely in a fork in the tree trunk.  You feel kind of 
bad for climbing the tree, but you see that it was worth the effort, if only 
because of the view you get of the forest from where you sit.  You feel like a 
king on a throne as you look down into a valley to the northwest.  You wonder 
what could be down there.  You decide to climb down and have a look.

a sudden, something to the south flashes in front of your eyes.  You feel sure 
by now that this is not just your imagination.

moves a little faster and you can see more signs of erosion.  For the first 
time you notice that it is not really grass that you are walking on, but 
clover.

It should logically be dark in there, but something in the walls seems to

	The walls are, as you can now see, lit by the reflection of the sun on 
small diamond chips in the walls.  If you try hard enough, you may be able to 
pry a chip or two loose.  As you do this, you cause a minor quake that seas the 
exit behind you.  It looks like the only way out of here is to the east.

There is a root nearby and it looks like, with a little effort, you could reach 
it and pull yourself up.

through.

that when you last passed this tree the hole was the size of your hand.  You 
panic as you realize that you must have shrunk while on your journey.  As you 
look around, the trees look much bigger than they did before.  Just when you 
decided that you are stuck at this small size forever, you feel yourself 
growing once again back to your normal size.  You shake your head in disbelief 
and decide to go back to the safety of the mighty Gate of Sorcerers.

   You are in an older wooden building that serves as the Town Hall of
Miller's Corners.  The floor underneath you is wood and creaks as you
move around.  The room you are in is not very large, and there are a few
doors that seem to lead to meeting rooms.  The building looks like the 
type of place where a town council would hold its meetings.  Off to one
corner is a long wooden table where many people can sit.  The floor around
it is well-worn and you guess that this building gets a lot of use.

shop.  There is a path running from east to west through the green that 
leads west to the sea and east to the rest of the village.

off quite a lot of heat.  There are tools that the Smith made for himself
lying nearby.  The Smith seems to be making a set of horseshoes for a 
horse that you can hear whinnying in an attached stable.  There is a large
collection of horseshoes hanging on a beam above the forge.

southwest is a large mill and just to the north, a very old well that looks
like it hasn't been used in years.

   You decide to lower yourself into the well and down onto the metal grate.
The grate seems to be sturdy as you test it out with one foot and then the
other.  You set both feet down on the grate and relax your grip on the well.
You study the make of the well, which seems to be made of large pieces of
impermeable rock.  The well itself looks deep, but you can't really guess
its depth, as there is complete darkness below.

goodness the hill isn't much higher than sea level.  To the north is the 
shipyard, while to the south is a large lumber mill.

   The operation that is set up here is a primitive sort of wood mill.  This
is a place where the people of the village can come to buy wood to make houses,
furniture, and many other things that they might need.  The wood supplies are 
brought into the harbor and cut to the customer's specifications at the mill.
The floor is very dusty and you sneeze a lot as you move around.  The floor
beneath you echoes to your footsteps.

&+WThe Shipyard&*^
   You are moving among many tall ships that are anchored in the harbour.
There seems to be a lot of shipping activity in the area.  Some of the ships
are much larger than others, but they are all made of wood and very finely
crafted.  One of the particularly beautiful ships that catches your eye seems
to be called "Susan".  Some of the boats closer to and on the shore seem to
have been there for quite a while.  There is a tiny boat on the shore that
seems to have sailed its last voyage and is now bleaching in the sun.

&+WThe Jetty&*^
   You have reached the high point of the hill and are standing on a 
type of wooden boardwalk, overlooking the sea.  There is a brisk, warm
breeze here that feels refreshing as it blows across your face.  Beneath
you, the hill drops out into the water, which beats against the dirt with
an incredible rate.  There is a little path beside the boardwalk that leads
down to a dry patch of sand below the jetty.

&+WUnder the Jetty&*^
   Under the wooden platform of the boardwalk above, you are standing on a
sandy strip of beach that is rather hard and packed, as though it is
often covered with water.  The wall under the jetty is made of stone to
prevent dangerous erosion.  Holding up the sea side of the boardwalk are
five tall and stately wooden poles, each covered in sea slime up to about
four feet.

&+WSecret Storage Room&*^
   Prying the metal sheet off of the stone wall that holds up the jetty, you
go into a rather dark and dank storage room underneath.  The room seems like
it hasn't seen the light of day in a very long time.  There are spiders 
crawling here and there, but they seem to be the only form of life that has
seen this place in many many years.  There is nothing particularly special
about the room.  It is carved into the hillside and was probably used
as a secret storage place long ago for pirated goods.  Way off to one corner
are the remains to what used to be a wooden chest.

&+WVillage Track&*^
   You are to the east of the village green, off of which are the main
administrative buildings of the town.  The track you are on is of hard
packed dirt and extends east and west from here.  To the east is another
path leading to the north that seems to lead to the village shops.  Off
to the west, the landscape rises and then cuts off sharply into the sea.
Just to the south is the entrance to the Village Inn.  To the north is 
a small village well; apparently still in use.

&+WThe Village Well&*^
   The well you are standing next to seems to be much newer than the one
west of the town hall, and seems to still be in use.  This well is not
blocked off and seems to go quite a distance into the ground.  You can
hear the slight sounds of water moving below.  The well is covered which
makes it difficult to see down into it, but you can guess the depth.
Somehow you think that climbing down into the well would be unwise.

&+WThe Village Well&*^
   Ignoring all general rules of safety, you decide to be adventuresome 
and lower yourself into the well.  At first you keep your hands on the
top of the well for a good grip,but as the well seems to be fairly dry,
you press your hands and feet against opposite walls and work your way
down into the well about 7 feet.  You take your left foot one more step
down, and suddenly the well isn't so dry anymore.  You lose your footing
on some slime and fall into the well below.  

			AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!

					SPLASH!!


You find yourself sitting on your butt in about a foot and a half of water.
What do you do now?

&+WThe Village Inn&*^
   The lobby area of the inn is rather nice.  There are several plush chairs
set up for people to sit in while they wait, or read the paper, or whatever
they wish to be doing.  The place is simple but tastefully decorated, and
seems to be reputable.  In the back, a door leads up the stairs to what
you believe to be rentable rooms.  To the east is another doorway that leads
into the bar.

   The bar is a dark and smokey place.  You take your place at a stool at
the bar, which is well-grooved from many years of use by passing sailors
and travelers alike.  The bar seems to serve a wide variety of drinks,
and you settle down with a beer.  Looking around the room, you see local
men drinking with their friends after a hard day's work, as well as a number
of people who, from their shyness, you guess aren't from around here. 
Yet another group of sailors is being rather rowdy at a table nearby.

the west.

the south.  On this street are many of the merchants of the village.  Here
you can find a weaponsmith, locksmith, a general store, and an armorer.

   The waiting room you are standing in displays many kinds of weapons made
by the weaponsmith who owns this shop.  He seems to be skilled in many
types of weapons; even some you don't recognize.  You can hear him working
away in the back room. 
   The little door that allows you to go behind the counter is open.

   In the waiting room you have entered, there are various pieces of armor
hanging on the walls. standing on the floor, and resting on tables.  They
all seem to be under the watchful eye of the armorer sitting in the back
so you don't dare try to take any of them.  Behind a counter is the work
area.

   You have reached the northern end of this street.  Beyond, to the north,
there is a river bank, and beyond, a large prairie filled with nothing but
tall grass.  On the other side, in the distance, you can see some incredibly
large mountains.  They seem to be at their most impressive off to the 
north-east.  
   To the west is the locksmith's and to the east is the General Store.
The main part of the village is back to the south.

   Here, the locksmith makes keys and locks for anyone who wants one.  The
smith himself seems to be at work on a particular key behind the counter.
All around you are examples of his work, including a huge key hanging on
one of the walls that seems a bit frivolous, but perhaps it serves some 
purpose of which you are not yet aware.

   The store is small and quaint but seems to have just about anything a
person could need.  The store sells food supplies, containers, guns,
fabric, and hundreds of other little necessities.  There are also several
items in the store that are not necessities but appear to be interesting
imported little items such as dolls and toys.

   The stream you are standing by could more likely be considered a small 
river.  The water is moving quite fast, and you feel that it would probably
be unwise to attempt to cross it.  The stream seems to flow from the 
north-east and the water is cold.  The water carries on to the west, where
it seems to pick up speed and get louder.

   The river is getting ever faster as you head down-stream.  The scenery
on the opposite side of the river is as breath-taking as ever.  The 
mountains you can barely make out are snow-capped; probably year-round.
Every once in a while, you think you hear a loud noise coming from that
general area, but you can't be sure.  The prairie grass on the other side
is teeming with life of all kinds.  The sun above is shining bright and
reflecting off of the river's water.  The noise you hear coming from the
west seems to be getting louder and louder.

&+WAt the Waterfall&*^
   Beyond you to the west is one of the most breath-taking sights you have
ever seen.  Here the river gets white and foamy as it cascades down a
waterfall.  Hitting the river below with tremendous force, the whole area
is alive with the sound of flowing water.  Not too far away this rushing
water joins the open sea in an eroded inlet.  There is a rocky path leading
down dangerously close to the waterfall.

   Where you are standing on the path, you are so close to the water that
 you can feel yourself being sprinkled upon by mist from the waterfall.
The noise around you is deafening.  Fortunately the water is far enough 
away that it is not drenching the path upon which you are walking.  Slowly
you can work your way down the path.

there.  The northern end appears to be blocked, but there is a path to the

a cold breeze blows down from the pass above you.  Below you are the lowlands
of this mountainous area, and grasses and scrub brush can be seen struggling
to grow there.  The path is littered with chunks of granite from the eons of 
creation that have passed.

   The peaks of the mountains surround you, their sharp outlines cutting into 
the horizon.  A cold wind bites into your exposed flesh, chilling you.  The

strong wind stirs up the snow around you, making it difficult to see.  The snow
is much deeper here, and small amounts of it slip into your boots from time to
time, making them cold.  It seems very quiet and desolate up here, and no one
has apparently been along in quite some time.  But with the shifting, drifting
snow, it is difficult to tell.

the mountain peaks, where you find some relief from the constant wind.  There
are some markings in the rocks, and some of them appear to have melted at some
point in the near past.  Apparently lightning storms are a common occurrence
here.  There is a path that goes off into the peaks above you, which you    
could climb with only moderate difficulty.

&+WWanderweg&*^
   You are on a grassy path which winds its way through some of the northern
foothills of the Teeth.  To the south, the pass grows progressively difficult,
but it is still possible to work your way through.  The path narrows greatly 
to the north, and with a survey of the area, you see a structure off to the 
far north.

&+WOverlook&*^
   You are in a small clearing in the north of Zaryat's Teeth.  A wooden bench
is off to one side, where you could rest and enjoy the view.  The vista from
here is an awe-inspiring one.  You command a view of a valley, through which
you see a small stream cutting its way.  Beyond the stream, you see a very
small temple on a hill. To the north, you see a large, fortress-like structure
rising from the cliff-tops.  The valley is adorned with trees, many of which
still retain some autumn colors.  Way off in the eastern horizon your keen eye
spies a tower on a ledge, and some buildings to the south of it.  There are 
some moors off to the far north-east.

&+WNarrow Path&*^
   The path narrows here, and the going is a bit more difficult.  Off in the 
distance you see the gates to a large citadel.  There is a rocky path winding
down to the valley floor below.  To the south, the path widens again, and 
starts to rise into a mountain range.  You can see some of the taller peaks,
capped in snow, with tufts of mist wafting around them.

   There is a dirt path which slopes down to the west, and rises to the east.
(Of course.)  You can hear the sound of running water off to the west, and a
bridge off in the distance makes you realize there must be a river there. 
There are fields of wildflowers stretching off to the north and south, their  
vibrant colors waving about in the cool autumn breeze.

&+WBy The River&*^
   You are standing by a burbling river, the clean water passing over the
riverbed, and continuing off to the north.  The sunshine and warm breeze lend
to a feeling of peacefulness in the area.  Some cute fish are swimming about
happily.  To your west, a wooden bridge spans the river, and to the east a path
slopes upwards.

   You are standing on a wooden bridge which spans a small river below you.
The sun reflects off the clear water, dazzling your eyes.  On the railing are
some carvings by various lovers and couples of years past.  To the west is a
road, which runs off into the horizon. A small trail leads south to the river.

   The road splits off into several directions here.  It appears to have rained
here recently, and the road to the south looks muddy.  A sandy patch lies off
to the west, and you see a dilapidated structure off to the north.  You hear a
babbling river off to the east, its pleasant tones putting you into a relaxed
mood.

should be able to make it to either end.

Rocky Road
   [ take two ]
   You are on a cobblestone road, although upkeep has been minimal in recent
times.  Grass can be seen forcing its way through the cracks.  Some brush is
growing off to the side, but from the looks of things, it's not happy to be
there.

&+WDecaying Land&*^
   The land here is, well, decaying.  The trees are mere skeletons, and the
grass is brown and dry.  Nothing seems to be living here, and you notice the
absence of birds chirping, and the usual hum of mosquitos.  The air smells
musty and old, like the inside of a vacuum.

&+WSandy Patch&*^
   There is a sandy patch of ground here.  A few bits of scrub brush are here, 
but otherwise there is no vegetation.  Come to think of it, there are no 
animals here, either.  The air smells tainted, as if a great spell had been
cast, or as if some evil being has been here recently.

content.  To the east lies a sandy patch, and a path works its way off to the
eastern horizon.  To the west you see the ruins of a large castle.

&+WBoathouse&*^
   You find yourself in a boathouse of sorts.  The ceiling has collapsed at one
end, allowing sunlight to work its way into the room.  Water is lapping up
against the pilons, but if there ever was a boat here, it is long gone.  The
river can be seen flowing by the eastern side of the building.  A bird's nest
can be seen in one of the rafters, but it too appears to have been abandoned.

&+WVillage Gate&*^
   On the path before you, the arched gateway to a town is attempting to stand.
Off to the left and right, the remains of an outer wall taper off into the
brush.  Weeds can be seen growing here and there from the cracks.  A rusted
gate hangs off one hinge, but you realize it won't be much longer.

&+WSchoolhouse&*^
   You are standing in a little red schoolhouse.  From your cursory glance, it 
doesn't appear as if anyone has been learning here recently.  The chalk board is
smashed, and papers and books lie scattered about the room.  The desks and
chairs have been thrown about, lending to the look of chaos. A doorway leads
out to the south.

   You find yourself on a road which apparently leads into the center of town.
To the left, a dilapidated schoolhouse is attempting to convey a look of    
importance, but failing miserably.  A tavern is off to the right, if you are 
interested in refreshment.

&+WTavern&*^
   You are in a tavern of once-reputable reputation.  Now it is musty and damp,
and in obvious disuse.  The room has been cleared of tables and chairs,        
apparently put in storage long ago.  Along the wall behind the bar is a large
mirror, now cracked and dirty.  The shelves are also bare, and some glass
shards twinkle on the floor.  Engraved on the top of the bar you read, "To be
or not 2B?"

&+WPlayground&*^
   The playground is overgrown with weeds now, although it probably was well 
cared for at one time.  Some toys lie here, discarded long ago and left to rot.
A little red schoolhouse lies to the north, and off to the east you notice a
town square of some kind.

&+WTown Square&*^
   You are standing in the square of the town.  The road is in really bad
condition here and you realize that this town has been emptied of people for
quite some time.  To the north is the village gate, and lands beyond.  Off to
the west you see a play area of some sort.  To the south you notice a bandstand or something.

&+WMouldy Shop&*^
   There are rotting shelves along one wall, and a table is slumped in the 
back of the shop.  The damp floorboards sag a bit under your weight, and the
place smells dank and musty.  Some jars on one of the shelves have exploded,
their rotten contents hardened onto the wall and floor.  Bits of glass lie   
scattered about.

&+WRotten Gazebo&*^
   You are standing in a dilapidated gazebo.  The structure looks on the verge
of collapse, and you realize that it wouldn't be all that bad if it did just 
that.  A few wooden chairs remain here, but they don't appear strong enough to 
hold the band members anymore.  The wood has long since lost any appeal and is
now a dull grey color.  Off to the east is a rotting old house, which looks
like it is tired of standing there.  On the doorpost you see the rusted remains
of the address, "2B".

   Inside the abandoned house you find lots of cobwebs, some dust and little  
else.  To the north, through some rotting doorposts, you see an old cellarhole.
A bench is along one wall, one leg partially chewed out by parasites of some 
kind.  A rotting door is off to your left, one hinge still holding it in place,
the other has apparently decided to go on to better things.  To the west,
through another doorway, you see a gazebo.

&+WCellar&*^
   The cellar is very damp and musty.  Off in the blackness you hear the sound
of dripping water.  A mouse runs away into a crevasse at the sound of your  
approach.  The floor - had it been dry - would be dirt, but is currently
occupied with the task of being mud instead.  It pulls at your boots slightly
as you step off the final step.  In front of you is a pedestal with a box
resting on it.  From its long, rectangular shape, and ornate finish, you guess
it to be a coffin.

   You are in a small square of some kind, with a large granite monument in

runes etched into its side.  To the south you spy a small white church, and
to the east is a small alleyway, leading into darkness.

center of town, and ends in a wall to the east.  Off to the south you see a    
parsonage to a church.  There are some containers of garbage here, but the    
contents have been partially consumed by something.  Your nose curls from the
stench here.

   The cemetery is a small, private lot.  A few marble headstones mark the 
resting place of some of the town's former residents.  Tufts of grass are
growing here and there, but otherwise the ground is barren.  A small breeze
blows past, stirring the dust up a bit.  One tombstone reads, "Here lies
George Pratt.  He missed the cliff, now he's flat."

   You find yourself inside an old church.  Overturned pews, smashed windows,
and graffiti on the walls show that it has been vandalized.  The altar remains
intact, however, but the linens have been removed long ago.  Off to the west
you see a small picket fence, and some gravestones.  To the east is a
parsonage.  With a bit of deduction, you realize that the parsonage must be for
this church.

   The parsonage, like most of the other buildings in the village, is damp and
musty.  The air hangs heavy here, as if it hadn't moved in several years.  The
tapestries along the opposite wall are rotten and covered with mildew.  To the
west you spy a rotting church, and to the north an open doorway opens out to
an alley of sorts.

&+WTurm&*^
   You are standing in an archway which runs through the center of a very
large tower.  Some steps lead upwards to the upper levels of the tower and
a drawbridge is open to the west.  Your boots click upon the cobblestones, and
you notice a rusty porticullis dangling overhead.  A path wanders off to the
east.

   The drawbridge appears to have been open for many years.  The chains hold-
ing both sides are rusty and stiff.  To your west you notice the inner gate
to a castle, now in ruins, while a large tower, probably for fortification,
rises to the east.  The moat below appears to have dried out long ago.

   The inner gate was once relied upon heavily, as you spy many scored marks

can venture to the east, across a drawbrige.

is a very large bird, and it might be wise to leave, before it returns.

light reflects off the surface, dazzling your eyes.  A light breeze tugs at
the spray, scattering it and causing a rainbow to appear.
   To the north you spy a courtyard, and to the west a small doorway opens
into the castle proper.

&+WTapestry Room&*^
   This small room used to house the castle's many fine tapestries.  A few 
mouldy ones remain, hanging limply and unattractively from the walls.  Some
straw covers the floor, apparently an attempt to make the room more comfort-
able.  There are several iron hooks in the wall that used to hold torches, but
have been emptied long ago.

&+WChapel&*^
   You are standing in the chapel for the castle.  A small altar indicating 
no specific denomination is in one corner.  Some murals adorn one wall, and
a cross hangs from the ceiling behind the altar.  Light shines in from a window
on one wall.
   To the north is the tapestry room, east affords an exit to the exterior of 
the castle, while to the south you spy a small side yard.

&+WSide Yard&*^
   The side yard is a small plot of grass wedged between the chapel to the
north and the main castle entrance to the south.  To the east is the castle
wall.  Along the side of the castle entrance are some marigolds and other 
flowers, providing a sweet fragrance to the air about you.

&+WCastle Hohenzollern&*^
   As you enter this room, you can't help but notice the large coat of arms
placed in one corner of the room.  A few statues and a suit of armor are placed
around the room as a form of decoration.  The ceiling is adorned with a paint-
ing of the heavens opening, and an outpouring of cherubim and seraphim adorn
the edges.  The trim of the room is a prime example of baroque architecture.
   To the north you notice a small side yard through a doorway, while the
eastern exit opens out into a courtyard.  An antechamber is through a doorway
to the south, and to the west you notice a large, empty hall.

&+WAnteroom&*^
   You find yourself in a small anteroom of the castle.  The room is now bare,
but looks like it was once comfortably furnished.  Some cobwebs have been 
spun by spiders past, and now collect dust in the corners.  To the north you
see the main entrance to the castle, to the west is the library.  A small
hole has been made in one wall.

&+WTower Base&*^
   You are standing in the base of a large tower.  Steps lead upward into dark-
ness, and continue down below.  Things smell musty and old here, as if no one
had been about for some time.  A finger run along the railing would surely be
dirty from dust.

&+WResearch Room&*^
   Many beakers, flasks and retorts make the purpose of this room clear.  Along
one wall a bookshelf leans, covered with old, leather-bound books of varying
size and color.  A table in the center of the room is covered in beakers full
of different liquids, some purple, some green, and many other colors.  A wooden
stool sits next to the table, apparently for the person who worked in the lab.
   A draft blows in from the tower base to the north.

&+WParsifal's Tower&*^
   This is apparently the tower of the wizard Parsifal.  As you think back, you
recall hearing of the greatness of Parsifal in a Bard's tale long ago.  Once
the Hohenzollern family was well-respected, but seemed to have run into
problems with a dragon that Parsifal had tried to tame.  Nothing had been heard
from the family since, and no one ever successfully returned from their castle.
   A small bed is in one corner of the room, and a table in the other.  The 
table is covered with old books and sheets of parchment.  A chair has been
overturned in the center of the room.

&+WDamp Tunnel&*^
   Water drips from the ceiling and runs along miniscule cracks in the walls.
A thin layer of mud on the floor coats about an inch of your boots, and makes
walking difficult as you slide about.  The tunnel slopes down sharply, and it
takes great effort to keep from sliding to the bottom.  You can make out the
base of the tower above you.

&+WDamp Tunnel&*^
   The air is clammy and cool against your exposed skin.  The dampness pervades
the air and room about you, chilling you a bit.  Apparently this used to be
under the moat and leaked quite profusely.  The tunnel continues off to the
east, and slopes upwards sharply.

  You are in a very dank, smelly, musty, {fill in adjective here}, hallway
which leads to a room to the east, or into a damp tunnel to the west.  Moss
grows upon the walls, and calcite adorns the floor in various spots.  Water is
beginning to seep into your boots, wetting your toes a little.

&+WDamp Room&*^
   You are in a small room, which is very damp and chilly.  A breeze is coming
in from a small hole off to one side.  You notice some light coming from that
direction, though not enough to see by.  The purpose of this room is unclear,
but you would venture to speculate that it was used as a means of escape in
times of war.

&+WCastle Treasury&*^
   The treasury seems to have been ransacked several times before.  If there
ever was a treasure, you can be sure it is long gone.  Some shelves which lined
the back wall are now broken or empty.  A legend has been enscribed into one
wall, apparently engraved with some spell.  It reads:
   Whosoever partaketh of the wizard's delight
   shall not quake nor quiver at any plight.

   Bookshelves run from floor to ceiling along every wall.  The room smells
very musty and dry, like autumn leaves on a warm day.  Books of varying color,
size, and topic adorn the shelves.  The room is dimly lit by some sort of
magical aura.

&+WTrophy Room&*^
   You are in a room with murals adorning the walls, depicting the great con-
flicts once fought by the knights of this castle.  Some chairs and a small
tapestry are arranged about a fire, which burns happily in a large stone fire-
place.  Some logs are stacked off to one side of the fireplace, and a poker
hangs just off to the right.

   You are standing in a very long hall.  The wooden floorboards echo to the
tread of your booted feet as you walk down the hall.  The many windows in
this hall allow a great amount of light into the room.  Stuffed animal heads,
like lions and tigers and bears (Oh my!), are hung periodically along the wall.
The ceiling is painted with murals depicting the hunts where the various
trophies were acquired.  To the east is the main entrance of the castle, and
to the south is a trophy room.  A large table in the room to the west brings
you to the conclusion that it's a dining room.

   This room appears to be one of the inner halls of the castle.  A doorway
opens up to a guard's room to the north, while another doorway stands to the
west.  The hall is rather cramped compared to some of the other rooms of the 
castle proper.  A few small tapestries attempt to enliven the otherwise dismal
walls of the hall.

   You are in a very small room, apparently a place for the guards to sit and
monitor prisoners.  A small table and chair are in one corner, while the rest
of the room is empty.  Some papers, probably logbooks, lie scattered about the
table.  To the south you notice a hallway, and a few steps west would take you
into a smaller hallway, which apparently leads to the dungeons.

   This short hallway links the guard room to the dungeons below.  A chilled
breeze blows from the stairwell, sending shivers up your spine.  The walls
are moist to the touch, and you notice mildew growing here and there, giving
the walls a polka-dot effect.

   The dungeon is cold and dank, as dungeons tend to be.  Some rusted shackles
hang from one wall, and you spy a ball and chain in one corner.  The floor is
covered in a thin layer of green slime, making walking treacherous.  As you
look about, you notice claw marks in the floor leading towards a bench at the
far wall, where they suddenly end.

ceiling above and you notice some small stalactites forming.

   You are in an enormous cave.  The ceiling is well out of the range of your
lightsource, as are several of the walls.  You can hear the echo of dripping
water in the distance.  A great feeling of awe overcomes you as you contemplate
the great power that must have gone into the makings of such a large cavern.
The dampness chills you a bit as you weave across the room, trying to avoid
some puddles of greenish water that lie about.  A small opening in the south
wall catches your attention.

   You find yourself in a smaller cavern than the last one, but still rather
impressive.  Stalagmites poke up from the floor here and there about the room.
Several shelves have been carved into one wall, apparently to store small
items.  As you walk further into the room, you notice some bones lying about
the floor.  A few seconds later, it dawns on you that these are human bones.

buckets in two corners, the function of which you would rather not think about.
A doorway to the east leads to a large hall, and you notice the kitchens to

one table, and a mouse scurries off into a corner.  A large black, cast-iron
stove is along the far wall, and shelves for food storage line another.  To
the north a swinging door leads to the dining room, and to the west is a 
small chamber, apparently used for the servants.

furniture, now rotting.  The rock walls are slightly damp to the touch and the

walls were once used for torches, which are now gone.  A tunnel slopes sharply
downwards into a room below, while stairs will take you back to the kitchen

Path along the cliff edge^
    The dirt path is surrounded by thick bushes, and has clearly been made
for some purpose. Just ahead, the bushes suddenly stop, and as you approach,
you gasp, almost walking right off a cliff. They really should warn people 
about that shouldn't they. The sudden drop has forced who ever made this path
to turn northward in their journey.

Alpine way^
    Winding it's way though this great mountain range, this path heads
southward toward what looks like a safer place to be; a nice grassy patch
of earth further on, by a river looks most inviting, and well looked after.
Ideal for a picnic perhaps. A few tall trees grow here, and gradually become 
thicker to the north, as the path through this range climbs a little further.

Lost in the mountains^
    Well you are not exactly lost, though you don't quit know where you are.
The village and the church are so far away now, but the one thing you have
in your favor for finding your way out, is this trail. The mountains all
round, closing you in, provide a natural path to follow, the only one possible
at this point. There is a small landslide ahead, but you can easily climb up.

On the rockslide^
    Below you, a path continues through the mountain range. More fallen rock
lays to the north, blocking the way through, but the vegetation to the east
has died, or been killed allowing you to continue toward a cliff edge.

Cliff edge^
    A solid rock ledge extends out past the last tree, sitting high
above a valley below. The dead trees and other vegetation here, seem to have
died for no reason, at least none that is visible; below in the valley
large parts of the forest have suffered in a similar way.
    A gust of wind blows you forward, toward the edge of the cliff, but
you are able to regain your balance; below you note the large fall, and
hard rocky surface. The winds here gust so much, even with a way to fly down
jumping would be crazy. Small paths wind their way through the valley below,
walked quite a lot from the looks of it. Following one heading east, a
small temple has been contructed on a mound and there is a tower someways
south east of that. Looking directly down, there is some movement outside
what looks like a cave leading into the very mountain on which you are
standing.

    A rockslide has greatly reduced the width of the trail through here, but 
there is still some access to the south, if you go out onto a cliff edge,
which looks quite safe from here. The trail continue for many miles northward, 
climbing in places, but in general it seems flat.

&+WOak Tree&*^
   You are sitting comfortably in the fork of a big branch.  The branches are
spread out high over your head.  The sun shines through the leaves, so that you
must shade your eyes with your hand to look up.

&+WOak Tree&*^
   You are high up, near the crest of the oak tree.  You can see the branches
of an elm tree to the north, almost touching the oak.  Farther away, the tops
of the trees thin out into little terraced fields propped by stone walls, and
groves dark with olive trees and walnuts.  In the distance is the sea where a
boat is idly sailing.

&+WElm Tree&*^
   You are in an elm tree, high above the ground.  This is not an easy tree to
move about on as the branches grow upwards, slender and thickly covered,
leaving little foothold.  To the north you can see the twisted shape of a fig
tree, to your west is a knobby walnut, and to your east is a mulberry.  In the
south are the oaks, haughty and detached.

   Some branches of the mulberry tree reach and overhang a high fortress-like
wall to your east.  Over the wall you can see a magnolia, from whose black
branches spring pulpy white flowers and shiny dark leaves.

&+WMagnolia Tree&*^
   The branches, although they are slender and of soft wood, bear your weight,
and the points of your shoes tear white wounds on the black bark.  You are
enveloped in the fresh scent of leaves, turned this way and that by the wind,
dull one moment and glittering the next.  Quite far below the lowest branch is
a mysterious garden, and to the east, a half-hidden mansion.  One high window
is quite near your tree.

   This looks like a little girl's bedroom.  An arched doorway leads east.
The room is beautifully furnished with curtains of white taffeta, a Persian
carpet, and a tiny canopied bed with cushions of pale yellow damask.  Rosewood
chairs surround a tiny silver table, with a doll's tea service set for two.

&+WMansion Landing&*^
   You are standing in a great pool of colored light, cast by the stained glass
of a vast coat of arms in a south-facing window, depicting an heraldic leopard.
To your west is an arched doorwary.  A huge, curving marble staircase extends
downwards into the mansion, past paintings and stern-looking busts.  You have
an uncontrollable desire to slide down a banister.

&+WIlex Tree&*^
   In the ilex, deep in the thickest press of leaves, you find a hanging
pavilion with curtains flapping in the wind, shaded by a large, fringed
parasol.  Stuck on the branches here and there are fluttering ribbons and
scraps of lace.  Butterflies dart in pairs among the curtains.

   Here in the mansion, silver shines and lacquer glows, carved gilt chairs
line the walls, sofas have legs like swans' necks and rest on lions' paws, and
a great deal of dust spirals slowly through the air, lit by innumerable softly
glowing candles. A marble staircase curves upwards, and you can see the gardens
through a doorway to the west.  To the south is the mansion library.

   In the gardens the branches spread out above you like the tentacles of
extraordinary animals, and the plants on the ground open up stars of fretted
leaves like the green skins of reptiles, and wave feathery yellow bamboos with
a rustle like paper.  A white flight of stairs leads east to the mansion. Above
you is a sweet-scented magnolia tree, but the lowest branch is too high for you
to reach.

&+WFig Tree&*^
   You are in a fig tree, under the pavilion of leaves, watching the sun move
slowly through the network of twigs and branches, smelling the scent of flowers
budding in the stalks.  The fig tree seems to absorb you, permeate you with its
gummy texture and the buzz of hornets, and you feel uneasy.  To the north is a
small olive grove.

&+WOlive Tree&*^
   This tree is hung all over with scrawled pieces of paper and bits of
cardboard with maxims from Seneca and Shaftesbury, and with various objects:
clusters of feathers, church candles, crowns of leaves, women's corsets,
pistols, scales, tied to each other in a certain order, the significance of
which has been lost.  The olive grove continues to the east.

&+WOlive Tree&*^
   This tree juts out from a cliff, and through the leaves and branches you
find the sea there facing you, calm and limpid and vast as the sky. The horizon
opens wide and high and the sea-blue is stretched bare, without a sail. You can
almost count the far-off ripples of the waves.  Only a very light rustle, like
a sigh, runs over the pebbles on the beach.  There are some roots hanging over
the cliff face here.  They look fairly sturdy, and you might be able to climb
down if you weren't carrying much.

&+WWalnut Tree&*^
   You are in an old and stately nut tree.  At the fork of the trunk is a
hollow, formed from an old ax wound.  A soft boarskin is stretched across the
hollow, making a cosy refuge in the shade of the dark green foliage.  In a deep
incision in the bark, now so old and deformed that it no longer seems the work
of human hands, is carved in big letters: Cosimo, Viola, and beneath: Ottimo
Massimo.

burrow.  The stench of fox permeates the burrow and gets even stronger towards
the south.  The air to the north is somewhat fresher.

   You are wedged into a reeking fox den.  Strangely enough, the vixen has
built her den adjoining a huge natural cavern that extends deep into the earth,
much farther than your feeble flame can penetrate.  It looks like it might go
all the way to China!  You could jump in, but you would fall a long way....
There is a blinking construction sign here.

   The roots end here and you are hanging precariously to the side of the
cliff.  You catch a glimpse of a hole behind the thick roots.  It's a tight
squeeze, but you could probably make it.  Getting back, however, is impossible.

&+WBehind the Roots&*^
   You are in a cramped underground tunnel.  A myriad of roots dangling from
the ceiling keep you from standing up straight.  From the northern end of the
tunnel, light streams down a low incline, dimly illuminating the tunnel.  It
feels as though someone is tapping you on your shoulder, but when you turn
around no one is there.

&+WSunny Clearing&*^
   You find yourself in a large clearing amongst the trees.  The sun shines
brightly throughout the trees here.  One particularly intense sunbeam shines 
upon a large rock near the northern end of the clearing.  At the southern end
you can make out neatly trimmed hedge rows, while a narrow path snakes through
the clearing from east to west.  A sloping hole has been dug out of the earth.

emplacements line the sides, and a small pile of cannon balls is beside each
cannon.  A small hatchway leads down into what is apparently the hold, and  a
small plank leads out over the ocean to the east.  Around the ship, you see
clear blue water, infested with man-eating sharks.

is immediately obvious that the pirates have transported a large variety of
objects in their ship, for you see everything from scraps of cloth to animal
droppings littering the floor.  To the south, a large door leads to the rest
of the ship.

from several portholes lining the walls, but it does nothing to lighten the
mood of the place.  A small doorway leads off to the west, a hallway extends
to the south, and a large door stands in the middle of the north wall.

&+WHigh Priest's Quarters&*^
   You are in what was once the home of the high priest, but is now the lair
of the mermaid. Various trinkets of the surface world line the room for
decoration, and a soft bed of seaweed is in one corner. At the north end of
the room, a large arch is built into the wall. Through the haze that fills
the center of the arch, you can make out a clearing in a forest. A doorway 
leads back into the altar room to the east.

of the room, and papers lie everywhere. There is a doorway to the west, and

itself is of the newest design.  The floor looks like it is made of highly

surround you are made of the heaviest dark wood and have golden door knobs.  
This building was clearly designed to be an office building, which is exactly 
what it is being used for.

   You have entered the Conference Room.  It is here that the powers hold their
meetings and conduct important MUD business.  In front of you is a huge table
with seats for eighteen.  The table is round, made of very heavy wood, and has
plenty of space for everyone to move around as well as take notes and memos.
It seems like the wood is very old, but it has been beautifully restored and
polished.  You can feel that many important decisions have been made around
this table for many centuries.  The chairs that surround the table are silver
and shine in the provided light.

there are a lot of cabinets, closets and storage chests here that seem to hold
ceremonial items.

narrow vertical shaft.  To the west you can crawl along a low, heavily shored
up tunnel towards a face.  Another ladder leads further down, but it is rotted
and descends only about ten feet before it disappears into the flooded depths
of the mine.
   To judge from the moss and slime on the wall, this part of the mine is often
flooded too.

bird feces on your face.

The grass is short, soft, and green, perfect for a picnic with your

   A single set of steps lead south, descending the huge mound upon which the
temple is built and ending in the forests below.

&+WEntrance to St. James Park&*^
   You are standing at the entrance to St. James Park.  Set in the middle
of London, very close to Westminster Abbey, the park is a refreshing change
from the dirt and bustle of the city itself.  The park stretches out to the
west and consists of many green lawns, a pond spanned by a single bridge,
and two stone paths; one on either side of the pond.  To the north is the
pond, to the south are the green lawns, and way ahead to the west you can
just make out the back wings of Buckingham Palace.  Outside the park to the 
south is the Abbey.

   Moving through the wading area, trying not to get your rolled-up pants
too wet, you realize how good the water feels to your feet.  You dip your
arms in and cool your wrists.  You then scoop up a little water in your
hands and put it on the back of your neck.  The water is rejuvinating,
and suddenly you feel refreshed.  To the west of you the water continues,
but a rope line keeps you from wading into that area.  You can, however,
canoe around the pond if you can find a boat along the shore.

looks as though there are a few boats lying around on the shore that you

&+WSt. James Park&*^
   Along the southern border of the park, you can look through the trees
and light wrought-iron fence into the city.  The buildings near you are
all rather old and have a lot of character.  You can hear the sounds of
the city not far off.  There seems to be major construction work underway
near the Abbey.

   You are near the western edge of the park.  Off to the west, the park
ends where it meets the fence of the Palace gardens.  You can see a bit
of the garden through the ivy growing on the fence, but your view is pretty
much obstructed.

   You are just south of the pond and east of the western gate of the park.
The wall near you which divides this area from the palace gardens is rather
nasty-looking.  To the north is the exit from the park to the palace.  The
rest of the city is way back toward the east.

looking fence around the gardens of the Palace.   To the north, people are
walking toward the palace, which is decked out in its full splendour for
the V-E Day Celebrations.

palace, indicating the presence of the Queen.

   You are up against the western wall of the park.  It seems to be several
feet thick.  At the top of the wall are rotating 6-inch spikes, each at an
angle to the one next to it.  To climb over the wall, one would have to have
a lot of faith in one's flexibility.  Perhaps it is best if you leave the
Queen alone.

The walls glisten with sorcery and from high above come the noises of high
level spells and experimentation.
   A doorway leads east into another room, and a door lies north.

   You are standing in a large storeroom which would be packed with magical
artifacts in normal times but it seems that the Sorcerer is using their power
for a large spell project that crackles from the top-most level of the tower.
   A doorway leads through to the east to the wraith room, and you tremble at
the thought of the creature which may lie through it, a creature which has been
known to slay even Enchanters in but a single blow...

of magic in all its form.  Flames dance over the walls to light the scene,
although they are merely for effect as a permanent fire fountain erupts from
the center of the room.  Gargoyles wink at you from the walls and objects move
quietly in complex patterns, getting on with the jobs they have been given.
   There is a door to the south, and a doorway leads west.  A splendid arched
window looks east across the world.

rooms of higher placed civil servants. To the north an exit leads into a

paper. The door is decorated with a painting of a climbing plant, which 
continues on the ceiling. The lamp is decorated in such a way that it looks

is. You can see some small faded drawings on the side of the cave. This must be
the archeological find of the year!

   You are standing on a set of narrow winding steps carved into the side of a
cliff face. The steps climb up and up above you, but below you can now make out
the ground, and the treetops.

leads east into the rest of the village.
   To the north is a small church, and a path leads west onto the village
market place, and to the gates of the village.
To the south, you can see what appears to be a castle.

   You are standing on a large square near the village gates. On special days
this square is completely filled with merchants selling their products. In the
middle of the square a very old oak provides some shadow from the sun. To the 
east the square changes into the village green. To the west you can see the old
gates that protected the village from the evils of the forest.

before made the step outside. An unknown number of them aren't around any
more to tell their story. The gates used to be heavily guarded, but it has
been a while now since the gates were closed. To the east you can enter
the village marketplace while to the west a path leads into the forest.
   Just outside the gates you can go south to a rough patch of land to the 
south of the village.

forgotten times. The Town hall is to the north of here. A small path to the

a small shed. A path leads south back to the main village road.

   You are standing in the 'Old Seadog' inn.  The inn radiates age and charm,
with its oak beam roof, and many seafaring momentos secured firmly around the
walls.  Even the bar is a single thick oak slab, worn and chipped with years of
service to rowdy sailors.
   The door out is west.

worn and pitted from years and years of heavy use.  Names are carved into its
surface, 'Black Sea Pete', 'Grey Hook', 'Moog The Kipper', no doubt some of the
pirates who long ago made this their haunt.
   A narrow stairway leads down, and a small room can be seen through a low
doorway to the east.

to them.  Indeed, even the lone window is a porthole, giving the room that
distinctive sea-cabin look.  A single low doorway leads west into the inn
proper.

numbing extent which goes on and on and on...

&+WFiery Passage&*^
   You are walking down a narrow fiery passage, the walls glow and pulsate with
a dull red light.  You have to tread carefully to avoid burning yourself on
some of the hotter parts of the floor.  The passage leads east and west, and a
turning leads north towards a fiery pit.

&+WBurning Gardens&*^
   You are standing in a wide open room.  The ceiling ends in a fancy wave of
rolled gold, which artfully reflects the fiery red skies down across the pools
of molten metal which form the centerpiece of the room.  The light from the
skies and the molten pits flickers around the room, flashing off the polished
and carved golden walls.

   You stand on a wide golden path, set on a high ledge overlooking a huge
crater.  The tremendous flames and explosions shake the whole mountain around
you, making the fiery red skies seem to vibrate and dance with each flash and
rumble.  The ledge goes back underground to the east and west.

The glowing walls are thick with sulphur, and the stench makes you want to

east it continues towards some steps.

cavern to an extent that the light is almost blinding, accompanied by almost
deafening explosions.  A path leads down almost suicidally close to the lava
river.

lead down into a canyon at one end of the cave and at the bottom faint light
flickers off water.

&+WFire Gate&*^
   You are in a large rocky and very uneven cave.  A smooth path has been cut
across the floor permitting easy walking.  The whole cave is filled with a
thundering roar which reaches deep into your mind.  A huge, deep and steep-
walled channel full of lava prevents you from going east through a huge
gateway.

into shadows.

&+WThe Hall Of Fire&*^
   You are in the hall of fire.  The very walls are tinged with a fiery
radiance, as if the rock itself is burning.  A red pentacle is near one wall
beside a picture carved in the wall.  A lever on one wall is beside a huge
metal drawbridge.  A passage leads east.

&+WLarge Damp Cave&*^
   You are in a large cave.  The cave echoes to the dripping of water from its
cold damp roof, thickly coated in algae and mosses.  A pillared hall stretches
off the the east, and a rocky canyon goes west.

&+WLow, Rough Passage&*^
   You are in a low rough passage which winds around and is clearly only an
escape route of some form.  A sign hanging on the wall reads in a rather crude
and untidy hand 'DANGER: STORM GIANTS CAN SERIOUSLY DAMAGE YOUR ELF'

   You are in a huge glittering cave.  Millions of tiny crystals on the wall
scintilate with rainbows of colors baffling your eyes and mind with a stunning
mass of changing color.  A set of huge steps lead upwards out of the cave, but
only a giant could hope to climb them.

&+WThe Temple&*^
   You are in a sinister temple.  Hideous shapes seem to reach out of nothing-
ness towards you and vanish as immaterial shadows.  The whole room radiates a
crushing sense of power filling you with awe and dread.  A huge fire burns at
an end of the temple, seemingly without a source.  Doorways lead lead north
and east.

&+WHidden Pasture&*^
   You are standing in a small hidden field, its lush grass coated with snow.
The pasture is enclosed on all sides by steep cliffs, save for a small gap to
the west which leads into a narrow ravine.  To the north is an old crumbling
hut of some sort.

&+WThe Hermit's Hut&*^
   This small dank hut appears to have once been the home of a hermit or maybe
even a sorceror of some form, as the rotting junk which litters the floor
contains bits of things you have never seen before.  A narrow doorway leads
south into fresh air.
