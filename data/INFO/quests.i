In addition to the points-requirement (see LEVELS), you need to solve quests
to become immortal. It's a good idea to start thinking about them as soon as 
possible. For information on quests you can use the &+WQINFO&* command.

Once completed, answers or directions may not be given away to lesser
experienced adventurers, although subtle hints are allowed.
