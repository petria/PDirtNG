THE HISTORY OF MUIR & MALAU

The history of Muir dates back to the old days that Darkness ruled the world.
In those times Satan used this place as a sanctuary for his loyal servents.
Because of this, the island has never been very populair with many humans.

At the end of the Age of Satan, the best magicians and warriors were able to
capture Satan and exiled him to the Moon. This was done by a secret ritual 
in which magic was used to hold Satan in control. It is said that The actual
ceremony that transported The spirit of Satan to the moon, was done at the
stone circles at the top of the hill, that is the centre of this island.

The myth also tells that the spirit of Satan still influences people who are
continuously in a drunken state. It also says that the magicians made sure
that people could travel to the moon when the spirit would gain control again,
to slay it once more.

On the stone is written a tale of how the demons were tricked 
into making a powerful lance that could destroy the most powerful demon with 
one blow.But the demons discovered the trickery before the lance was completed
and sent a Death Knight to kill those who had tricked them. When he returned the
Knight was given the lance to guard lest it fall into the wrong hands and be
completely wrought.

It's obvious that this sword has seen a lot of use, and a lot of
care. It's edges are extremely sharp! If you don't stop playing
around with it, you'll end up a few fingers short!

Great Worm of Newurk to single combat. And his description of the
destruction of the Temple of Balzuv in the conflagration known as
the "Great Balsuv Fire". Most of it seems pretty silly, but the

This is no fake stage knife... as the blade is fixed quite firmly.  It would
certainly hurt anyone who was silly enough to get in the way of it, and it
would be advisable to stop playing with it before you cut yourself!

The koan reads:
        One day, Cedric and Ged found themselves standing at the
        entrance to the Catacombs.
        Said Ced, "How are we ever to traverse this maze of catacombs?"
        Said Ged, "I do not know, for the interconnections of its
                   chambers are most intricate.  Perhaps we should ask
                   Tedd, the Zen Master of Aber."
        So they did.
        Said Ged, "Oh wise and most learned Tedd, how can one find one's
                   way through the treacherous maze of the catacombs?"
        Said Tedd, "One can't.  Send Ned."
        And suddenly Cedric and Ged were most pleased, for Tedd had
        shown them the path to enlightenment.

Most of the writing is too faint to read.  It appears to have been a diary.

   | warrior as well, a rare combination. We apologize for the shabbiness     |
   | of this little church, but a terrible tragedy has overcome us. Many      |
   | years ago, a terrible vampire invaded our little village. Our protector, |
   | Saint Suorac, tried to fight him, but to no avail. The Vampire easily    |
   | defeated our valiant hero, and plunged the Cathedral into &+Ldarkness&*,      |
   | transforming it into his &+rdemonic lair&*, a malignant blot against the      |
   | &+Cskyline&*. It may be beyond salvation, for it houses many &+Levil&* creatures,  |
   | But hidden deep within are our precious holy relics. There are five of   |
   | them. We urgently need for someone to brave the evils of the cathedral   |
   | and return our relics to us. Four of the relics are material things of   |
   | great spiritual value... The fifth is the very bones of Saint Suorac     |
   | himself. It is our custom to save the bones of our holy defender, as a   |
   | symbol of faith. If you are up to it, we would be most grateful if you   |
   | would take up this quest, kill the vampire, and return our relics to     |
   | this humble church. Perhaps when all this is over, we can return and     |
   | rebuild our Cathedral into the holy place it once was. The &+RVampire&*       |
   | cannot be defeated easily. Find a way to use his powers against him.     |
   | Take this key, it is old and &+yrusty&*, but it should open at least one of   |
   | the doors.                                                               |

It is fancifully woven from sheep's wool, with interesting runes making
artistic designs around the hood and edges, an ornate metal clasp for the

This small red lantern has a round latch-lock door on one side, a wick

One fur, though, looks a faded pink, and has a long pink tail trailing from
it.

A small book labeled "My Diary" rests here on a small shelf.^
^

This appears to be a poorly written diary of a trapper that practices his
trade in the swamplands.   Most of the entries recount mundane catches and
places that the trapper has been to, but one entry catches your attention:

'Reset 509, 2 hours and 45 minutes:

The journal seems to belong to Dinthiar, the elven king.  It speaks of what
has happened to this once beautiful land.  It seems that there were two
great evils, who had been engaged in an eternal war with each other.  They
had shifted from world to world, leaving each one a desolate ruin behind
them.  Sadly, one day the two evils came down upon this beautiful realm.
Here, their last battle was fought.  One of the two, a demon of great power,
still resides in the caves to the west, lording over the land he helped
destroy.  The other, a deathless lich, was forced to flee.  It is rumored
though, that he still hides somewhere in these lands.  Dinthiar believes
that the elven lands can still be restored.  What is needed is a great hero
to vanquish the two ancient evils...

The blackboard is made of one single piece of black marble, measuring about
6 times 8 feet, and 2 inches in thickness.  It's surface has a smoothness that
permits chalk being used for writing and drawing.  You do have an eye for art,
but the numbers, financial formulas and curves showing income and expenses
tell you nothing, so you leave the blackboard as it is.

&+WWarning to experienced adventurers!&*

I would like to warn you that the quest has been changed here from what you are
probably used to. I have decided to stick more to the original story and have
made it &+rIMPOSSIBLE&* to use the put xxx in yyy trick. This is a bug which is
on almost all muds!

The real solution lies in this door here, examine it and dont get locked in!

Signed,

                DEAFEN, DUMB, CRIPPLE, BLIND and CURE

The runes also allude to a spell for summoning people, SUMMON, but
note that several amulets and talismans can protect the victim from
its effects.
        A spell for finding the exact locations of players, objects
and mobiles, WHERE, is also mentioned.

A heavy iron bound book has been left here.^
^

The book details many arcane and powerful magic, mostly to cause
 severe pain to other beings.  In a flowing hand is written:

Fireball
        A potent piece of magic much dependent upon the power of the caster
        as to the damage it does, although sulphur enhances this.
Missile
        A similar magic, much popular amongst mages.  It is said that magical
        talismans may be created to aid this spell.
Shock
        A spell of touch, which can pass through metal armors with great ease.
        A decent caster never uses this as a party trick.
        Lodestones help with its casting.
Frost
        A spell similar to a fireball in power. A direct hit will slow
        your opponent down and make his aim less sure.  It is said that
        wintergreen will enhance this spell.

Any mage should beware that casting magic, though potent, will drain the
Strength of the caster.
